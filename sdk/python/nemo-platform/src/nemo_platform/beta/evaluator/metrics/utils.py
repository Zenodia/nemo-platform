def metric_type_name(metric: Metric) -> str:
    """Resolve a stable public type name for one runtime metric.

    Args:
        metric: Metric object used during execution or optimization.

    Returns:
        ``metric.type.value`` for built-in ``MetricType`` members, otherwise
        the custom string metric type, otherwise the metric class name.

    This helper exists for generic call sites that operate on the runtime
    ``Metric`` protocol and must support the documented ``Metric.type`` shapes
    without depending on enum-only APIs:

    - built-in ``MetricType`` members
    - plain string custom metric types
    - custom string-based enum members, such as ``class MyMetricType(str, Enum)``

    Examples:
        Built-in metrics still commonly expose ``MetricType`` members, so a
        BLEU runtime metric resolves to ``"bleu"`` via ``metric.type.value``.

        Custom metrics may expose ``type`` as a plain string such as
        ``"my-custom-metric"``, or as a custom string-based enum member; both
        are returned as their string identifier.
