"""Shared HTTP clients for SDK and internal requests.

Ideally, most consumers get their HTTP client from DependencyProvider, which
manages per-service client lifecycle. However, code often constructs SDKs in
isolation (tasks, controllers, background jobs) without access to a
DependencyProvider. These shared clients prevent each SDK instantiation from
creating a new HTTP client, avoiding connection pool and SSL context overhead.

Used by:
- get_platform_sdk() / get_async_platform_sdk() for tasks, controllers, and
  other code outside DependencyProvider context
- Platform shutdown cleanup via close_cached_http_clients()

The wrapper classes make close()/aclose() a no-op so that SDK code can safely
call sdk.close() without affecting other users of the shared client. Actual
cleanup happens at shutdown via close_cached_http_clients().
