# Entities

Entities are the underlying data objects that power the {{platform_name}}. Models, datasets, jobs, configurations, and other resources are all represented as entities in the platform's storage layer.

## How Entities Work

Each service in the platform—Evaluator, Guardrails, and others—stores its resources as entities. This shared foundation provides consistent behavior across services:

- **Common metadata** — All entities have standard fields like name, workspace, timestamps, and custom fields
- **Unified storage** — Resources from different services live in the same entity store
- **Consistent operations** — Create, read, update, and delete follow the same patterns

---

## Workspace-Scoped Entities

Entities are always scoped to a **workspace**. When you create or reference an entity (for example, a model, a fileset, or an evaluation job), it belongs to the workspace you are using in the CLI or SDK. Entity names are unique within a workspace, and access control is applied at the workspace level—so the same entity name can exist in different workspaces for different teams or projects.

## Working with Entities

In most cases, you interact with entities through service-specific APIs rather than a generic entity API. The platform CLI and Python SDK expose these through familiar commands and client methods:

- **Evaluator** — Create metrics, benchmarks, and evaluation jobs; retrieve results. See [About Evaluating](../../evaluator/index.md) and the evaluation tutorials.
- **Models and inference** — Register model entities, create deployments, and run inference through the gateway. See [about](../../run-inference/about.md) and the inference tutorials.

These service APIs provide typed interfaces and validation specific to each resource type, built on top of the entity system. For raw HTTP access, see the [Entity Store API reference](../../api/index.md#tag-entity-store).
