# Studio Development Mode

You are now in **Studio development mode**. Read the Studio project instructions to load full context:

@web/CLAUDE.md

## What This Means

- **Most changes will be in `web/`** — this is a React + TypeScript monorepo for NeMo Studio
- **The rest of the repo is useful for understanding** backend APIs, data models, and SDK types, but changes should generally stay within `web/`
- **Studio-specific skills are now available** — use `/unit-test`, `/e2e-test`, and `/visual-dev` for testing and development workflows
- **Run frontend commands from `web/`** — pnpm, vitest, and other Node.js tooling lives there
