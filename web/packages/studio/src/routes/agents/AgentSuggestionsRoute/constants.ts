        You are an evaluator. Score whether the generated answer correctly
        addresses the question compared to the expected answer description.
        Rules:
        - Score is a float between 0.0 and 1.0.
        - 1.0 means the answer fully satisfies the expected answer criteria.
        - Provide a 1-2 sentence reasoning.
