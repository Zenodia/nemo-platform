# About Fine-Tuning

<a id="ft-about"></a>
Learn how to fine-tune models by making requests to NVIDIA NeMo Customizer through the API. Fine-tuned models you have created can be deployed using NVIDIA NIMs.

## Fine-Tuning Workflow

<a id="ft-workflow"></a>
At a high level, the fine-tuning workflow consists of the following steps:

1. [Create a Model Entity](manage-model-entities/index.md) pointing to your base model checkpoint (stored as a FileSet).
1. Format a compatible [dataset](tutorials/format-training-dataset.md).
1. [Create a customization job](manage-customization-jobs/index.md) referencing the Model Entity.
1. Monitor the job until it completes.
1. The customization job automatically creates either:
 - **LoRA jobs**: An adapter attached to the original Model Entity
 - **Full fine-tuning jobs**: A new Model Entity with the customized weights
1. [Deploy the model](../run-inference/about.md) using the Deployment Management Service.
1. Move on to [Evaluate the output model](../evaluator/index.md).
