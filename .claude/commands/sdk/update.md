Update the Python SDK for NeMo Platform by following these steps:
- ensure the OpenAPI spec is up-to-date (ask the user and if needed, run the `/script/generate-openapi-spec.sh` script to regenerate it)
- run `./sdk/stainless.sh sync` to update the SDK code from the OpenAPI spec
- troubleshoot any issues using information in @sdk/README.md
