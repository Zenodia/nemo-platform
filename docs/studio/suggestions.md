# {{studio_short_name}} Suggestions

Use {{studio_short_name}} **Agents > Suggestions** to review optimizer suggestions for agents in the selected workspace.

## What {{studio_short_name}} Shows

{{studio_short_name}} loads the latest optimizer snapshot and suggestions from the platform files service. Suggestions can be scoped to a workspace or to a specific agent.

The Suggestions page summarizes:

- The number of agents and models observed in the latest optimizer snapshot.
- Suggestion counts by priority.
- Workspace-wide suggestions.
- Agent-specific suggestions grouped by agent.

## Filter Suggestions

Use the table filters to narrow suggestions by:

| Filter | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Type | Focus on model optimization, guardrail, data safety, or new-model suggestions. |
| Priority | Show high-, medium-, or low-priority suggestions. |
| Scope | Separate workspace-wide suggestions from agent-specific suggestions. |
| Agent | Review suggestions for one agent at a time. |

## Run an Optimization Pass

If there are no suggestions, or if the latest snapshot is stale, {{studio_short_name}} starts a new optimizer pass for the workspace. The optimizer analyzes deployed agents and writes updated suggestions back to the platform files service.

## Apply Suggestions

{{studio_short_name}} can apply supported suggestions from the Suggestions page. Model optimization suggestions may ask you to choose an evaluation config before applying the change.

## Next Steps

- [{{studio_short_name}} Agents](agents.md): review, deploy, chat with, and delete agents from {{studio_short_name}}.
- [{{studio_short_name}} Monitor](monitor.md): inspect recent agent telemetry, token usage, and inference logs.
- [Optimize Agents](../agents/optimization.md): run CLI-driven optimization and review the underlying checks.
