# NeMo Platform Plugins

This directory contains first-party NeMo Platform plugins. Each subdirectory is a standalone Python package that registers one or more surfaces with the platform via entry points.

## Installing a plugin

From the repository root, sync the platform environment and install the plugin package into the same virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
uv pip install -e plugins/<plugin-name>/
```

Example:

```bash
uv pip install -e plugins/example-plugin/
```

Restart `nemo services run` after installing or uninstalling plugins. Service, controller, and inference middleware entry points are discovered at platform startup.

## Default bootstrap behavior

`make bootstrap-python` syncs the root uv workspace. Bare `uv sync` and `make bootstrap-python` include the `enabled-plugins` dependency group by default through `tool.uv.default-groups`.

Reference plugins such as `plugins/example-plugin/` are not installed by default.

### Switchyard middleware

`plugins/nemo-switchyard/` is an inference middleware plugin. It registers the `nemo-switchyard` middleware entry point, which can be referenced from a VirtualModel's `request_middleware` or `response_middleware`.

The middleware is installed by default through the root workspace's `enabled-plugins` group. The plugin vendors the required subset of the Switchyard library under `plugins/nemo-switchyard/vendor/switchyard/`, so no separate checkout, `SWITCHYARD_PATH`, or PyPI-shadow workaround is needed.

```bash
uv sync
```

For the canonical setup steps, see [Switchyard Inference Middleware Plugin](nemo-switchyard/README.md).

With the platform running, use `nemo-switchyard` in VirtualModel middleware config:

```json
{
  "name": "nemo-switchyard",
  "config_type": "translate",
  "config": {"target_format": "auto", "enable_stats": false}
}
```

## Uninstalling a plugin

```bash
uv pip uninstall <package-name>
```

The package name is the `name` field in the plugin's `pyproject.toml`, not the directory name.

| Directory | Package name |
|---|---|
| `example-plugin/` | `nemo-example-plugin` |
| `nemo-agents/` | `nemo-agents-plugin` |
| `nemo-anonymizer/` | `nemo-anonymizer-plugin` |
| `nemo-data-designer/` | `nemo-data-designer-plugin` |
| `nemo-evaluator/` | `nemo-evaluator-plugin` |
| `nemo-guardrails/` | `nemo-guardrails-plugin` |
| `nemo-switchyard/` | `nemo-switchyard` |

Example:

```bash
uv pip uninstall nemo-example-plugin
```

## Verifying a plugin is active

```bash
# CLI commands appear under the plugin name:
nemo <plugin-name> --help

# Service routes are mounted at /apis/<plugin-name>:
curl http://localhost:8080/apis/<plugin-name>/health
```

Inference middleware plugins do not necessarily add CLI commands or HTTP routes. Verify they are loaded by checking platform startup logs for the middleware entry point, then reference that entry point from a VirtualModel:

```bash
# Example log text emitted during platform startup:
# Loaded inference middleware plugin: nemo-switchyard
```

## Writing a new plugin

See `packages/nemo_platform_plugin/` for the public contract. A basic plugin only needs `nemo-platform-plugin` as a dependency — no access to `nmp-common` or platform internals is required.

Entry points point to **classes**, not instances. The platform instantiates each class at startup, which keeps the plugin author out of the construction lifecycle and makes future dependency injection straightforward.

Minimum `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "nmp-my-plugin"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = ["nemo-platform-plugin"]

[project.entry-points."nemo.services"]
my-plugin = "nmp.my_plugin.service:MyService"

[project.entry-points."nemo.cli"]
my-plugin = "nmp.my_plugin.cli:MyCLI"

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/nmp"]
```

Normal plugin packages only need `hatchling` in `build-system.requires`. `nmp-build-tools` is reserved for first-party packages that declare `[tool.bundle-package]` and need to bundle workspace sources into a published wheel.

Minimum service implementation:

```python
# src/nmp/my_plugin/service.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
from nemo_platform_plugin.service import NemoService, RouterSpec

class MyService(NemoService):
    name = "my-plugin"
    dependencies = []

    def get_routers(self) -> list[RouterSpec]:
        router = APIRouter()

        @router.get("/health")
        async def health() -> dict[str, str]:
            return {"status": "ok"}

        return [RouterSpec(router, tag="My Plugin")]
```

Minimum CLI implementation:

```python
# src/nmp/my_plugin/cli.py
import typer
from nemo_platform_plugin.cli import NemoCLI

class MyCLI(NemoCLI):
    def get_cli(self) -> typer.Typer:
        app = typer.Typer(help="My plugin commands.")

        @app.command()
        def run(model: str) -> None:
            """Run something."""
            typer.echo(f"Running with {model}")

        return app
```
