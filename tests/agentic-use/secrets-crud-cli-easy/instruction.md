# Secret CRUD Operations (CLI)

You have access to the `nemo` CLI for NeMo Platform operations. Note: MCP tools are not available in this environment - you must use the CLI.

## Task

Complete the following secret CRUD operations using the `nemo` CLI:

1. Create a secret named `harbor-test-secret` with the value `my-super-secret-value-123` and description `Test secret for harbor eval`
2. Verify the secret was created by retrieving its metadata with `nemo secrets get harbor-test-secret`
3. List all secrets in the workspace and confirm `harbor-test-secret` appears
4. Update the secret with a new value `updated-secret-value-456` and description `Updated test secret`
5. Verify the update was applied by retrieving the secret metadata again
6. Delete the secret with `nemo secrets delete harbor-test-secret`
7. Create a new secret named `harbor-final-secret` with value `final-value-789` and description `Final secret for verification`

## Available CLI Commands

The `nemo` CLI is available at `/app/.venv/bin/nemo`. You can use these commands:

- `nemo secrets create <name> --data "<value>" --description "<description>"` - Create a secret directly
- `nemo secrets get <name>` - Retrieve secret metadata (value is never exposed)
- `nemo secrets list` - List all secrets in the workspace
- `nemo secrets update <name> --data "<new-value>" --description "<description>"` - Update a secret directly
- `nemo secrets delete <name>` - Delete a secret

Note: The CLI connects to the local NeMo Platform API server at http://localhost:8080 by default.

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
- A secret named `harbor-test-secret` was created, updated, and then deleted
- A secret named `harbor-final-secret` exists with the description `Final secret for verification`
- The secret `harbor-test-secret` no longer exists (was deleted)
