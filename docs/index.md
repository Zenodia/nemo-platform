# {{platform_name}}

Make the agents you ship faster, more accurate, and safer.

{{platform_name}} brings NVIDIA NeMo libraries together under one CLI, Python SDK, and web UI. Hardening, evaluation, and tuning for the agents you put in production.

## What You Can Do

- **Secure agents.** Guardrails (content safety, jailbreak detection, PII redaction), Auditor (red-teaming via garak), Anonymizer (PII handling for training data).
- **Evaluate agents.** LLM-as-judge, deterministic, agentic, and RAG benchmarks. Harbor-backed eval suites for regression testing.
- **Tune agents.** Skill optimization, prompt and hyperparameter tuning, Switchyard model routing.
- **Build agents.** NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT) for LangGraph-based agents. Shared infrastructure: Inference Gateway, Secrets, Files, Entity Store, Jobs.
- **Generate synthetic data.** Generate synthetic data for training or evaluation purposes using Data Designer.
- **NeMo Studio (alpha).** Installed automatically with the platform. Studio is a browser UI for chatting with agents and models, starting and monitoring various jobs, and reviewing results. Studio's agent-focused features are still a work in progress; the CLI is the primary surface today.

## Platform Capabilities

The platform provides several shared capabilities to NeMo libraries.

- [Models and Inference](run-inference/about.md) for model providers, virtual
  models, and gateway calls.
- [Files](get-started/concepts/manage-files.md), [Secrets](get-started/concepts/manage-secrets.md),
  [Entities](get-started/concepts/entities.md), and jobs for storing state and
  running local work.

## Where to Go Next

- [Setup](get-started/setup.md) - install, configure providers, and run
  local services.
- [About Agents](agents/index.md) - learn the managed agent lifecycle.
- [Optimize Agents](agents/optimization.md) - improve cost, quality, and model
  routing.
- [Secure Agents](agents/security.md) - harden agents with guardrails and data
  safety checks.
