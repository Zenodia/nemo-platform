## **Model Overview**

### **Description**

The Llama Nemotron Embedding 1B model is optimized for **multilingual and cross-lingual** text question-answering retrieval with **support for long documents (up to 8192 tokens) and dynamic embedding size (Matryoshka Embeddings)**. This model was evaluated on 26 languages: English, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, and Turkish.

In addition to enabling multilingual and cross-lingual question-answering retrieval, this model reduces the data storage footprint by 35x through dynamic embedding sizing and support for longer token length, making it feasible to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.

An embedding model is a crucial component of a text retrieval system, as it transforms textual information into dense vector representations. They are typically transformer encoders that process tokens of input text (for example: question, passage) to output an embedding.

This model is ready for commercial use.

The Llama Nemotron Embedding 1B model is a part of the NVIDIA NeMo Retriever collection of NIM, which provide state-of-the-art, commercially-ready models and microservices, optimized for the lowest latency and highest throughput. It features a production-ready information retrieval pipeline with enterprise support. The models that form the core of this solution have been trained using responsibly selected, auditable data sources. With multiple pre-trained models available as starting points, developers can also readily customize them for domain-specific use cases, such as information technology, human resource help assistants, and research & development research assistants.

We are excited to announce the open sourcing of this commercial embedding model. For users interested in deploying this model in production environments, it is also available via the model API in NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIM) at [llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2).


### **Intended use**

The Llama Nemotron Embedding 1B model is most suitable for users who want to build a multilingual question-and-answer application over a large text corpus, leveraging the latest dense retrieval technologies.

### **License/Terms of use**

Use of this model is governed by the [NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license/). Additional Information: [Llama 3.2 Community Model License Agreement](https://www.llama.com/llama3_2/license/).

### **Model Architecture**

**Architecture Type:** Transformer
**Network Architecture:** Fine-tuned Llama3.2 1B Retriever

This NeMo embedding model is a transformer encoder - a fine-tuned version of Llama3.2 1b, with 16 layers and an embedding size of 2048, which is trained on public datasets. The AdamW optimizer is employed incorporating 100 warm up steps and 5e-6 learning rate with WarmupDecayLR scheduler. Embedding models for text retrieval are typically trained using a bi-encoder architecture. This involves encoding a pair of sentences (for example, query and chunked passages) independently using the embedding model. Contrastive learning is used to maximize the similarity between the query and the passage that contains the answer, while minimizing the similarity between the query and sampled negative passages not useful to answer the question.

### **Input**

**Input Type:** Text
**Input Format:** List of strings
**Input Parameter:** 1D
**Other Properties Related to Input:** The model's maximum context length is 8192 tokens. Texts longer than maximum length must either be chunked or truncated.

### **Output**

**Output Type:** Floats
**Output Format:** List of float arrays
**Output:** Model outputs embedding vectors of maximum dimension 2048 for each text string (can be configured based on 384, 512, 768, 1024, or 2048).
**Other Properties Related to Output:** N/A

## **Training Dataset & Evaluation**

### **Training Dataset**

The development of large-scale public open-QA datasets has enabled tremendous progress in powerful embedding models. However, one popular dataset named MS MARCO restricts ‌commercial licensing, limiting the use of these models in commercial settings. To address this, NVIDIA created its own training dataset blend based on public QA datasets, which each have a license for commercial applications.

**Data Collection Method by dataset**: Automated, Unknown


**Labeling Method by dataset**: Automated, Unknown


**Properties:** Semi-supervised pre-training on 12M samples from public datasets and fine-tuning on 1M samples from public datasets.


### **Evaluation Results**

Properties: We evaluated the NeMo Rtriever embdding model in comparison to literature open & commercial retriever models on academic benchmarks for question-answering - [NQ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BeIR/nq), [HotpotQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hotpot_qa) and [FiQA (Finance Q\&A)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BeIR/fiqa) from BeIR benchmark and TechQA dataset. Note that the model was evaluated offline on A100 GPUs using the model's PyTorch checkpoint.  In this benchmark, the metric used was Recall@5.

| Open & Commercial Retrieval Models | Average Recall@5 on NQ, HotpotQA, FiQA, TechQA dataset |
| ----- | ----- |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 2048) | 68.60% |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 384) | 64.48% |
| llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v1 (embedding dim 2048) | 68.97% |
| nv-embedqa-mistral-7b-v2 | 72.97% |
| nv-embedqa-mistral-7B-v1 | 64.93% |
| nv-embedqa-e5-v5 | 62.07% |
| nv-embedqa-e5-v4 | 57.65% |
| e5-large-unsupervised | 48.03% |
| BM25 | 44.67%  |

We evaluated the multilingual capabilities on the academic benchmark [MIRACL](https://github.com/project-miracl/miracl) across 15 languages and translated the English and Spanish version of MIRACL into additional 11 languages. The reported scores are based on an internal version of MIRACL by selecting hard negatives for each query to reduce the corpus size.

| Open & Commercial Retrieval Models | Average Recall@5 on multilingual |
| ----- | ----- |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 2048) | 60.75% |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 384) | 58.62% |
| llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v1 | 60.07% |
| nv-embedqa-mistral-7b-v2 | 50.42% |
| BM25 | 26.51% |

We evaluated the cross-lingual capabilities on the academic benchmark [MLQA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MLQA/) based on 7 languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Hindi, Spanish, Vietnamese). We consider only evaluation datasets when the query and documents are in different languages. We calculate the average Recall@5 across the 42 different language pairs.

| Open & Commercial Retrieval Models | Average Recall@5 on MLQA dataset with different languages |
| ----- | ----- |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 2048) | 79.86% |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 384) | 71.61% |
| llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v1 (embedding dim 2048) | 78.77% |
| nv-embedqa-mistral-7b-v2 | 68.38% |
| BM25 | 13.01% |

We evaluated the support of long documents on the academic benchmark [Multilingual Long-Document Retrieval (MLDR)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shitao/MLDR) built on Wikipedia and mC4, covering 12 typologically diverse languages. The English version has a median length of 2399 tokens and 90th percentile of 7483 tokens using the llama 3.2 tokenizer. The MLDR dataset is based on synthetic generated questions with a LLM, which has the tendency to create questions with similar keywords than the positive document, but might not be representative for real user queries. This characteristic of the dataset benefits sparse embeddings like BM25.

| Open & Commercial Retrieval Models | Average Recall@5 on MLDR |
| ----- | ----- |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 2048) | 59.55% |
| llama-nemotron-embed-1b-v2 (embedding dim 384) | 54.77% |
| llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v1 (embedding dim 2048) | 60.49% |
| nv-embedqa-mistral-7b-v2 | 43.24% |
| BM25 | 71.39% |
