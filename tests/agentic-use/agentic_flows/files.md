|---|-----------|------------|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 4 | Fileset CRUD Operations | 1 | No | `files-crud-cli` | Create a fileset, upload a file, list files, download file content, delete file and fileset. This replaces the old datastore functionality. | POR; tests/e2e/test_files.py |
| 5 | Upload Dataset to Files Service | 2 | No | `files-upload-dataset-cli` | Create a fileset, upload training/validation/testing JSONL files (similar to the old HuggingFace datastore flow), and register as a dataset entity. | POR |
