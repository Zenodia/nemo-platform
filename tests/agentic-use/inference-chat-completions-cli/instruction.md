# Chat Completions via Inference Gateway (CLI)

You have access to the `nmp` CLI for NeMo Platform operations. Note: MCP tools are not available in this environment - you must use the CLI.

The `nmp` CLI is available at `/app/.venv/bin/nmp`. The CLI connects to the local NeMo Platform API server at http://localhost:8080 by default.

## Context

A mock inference model (`default/chat-model`) has been pre-configured in this environment. This model returns a fixed chat completion response to any prompt, so you can test the full chat completions flow without a real LLM backend.

## Task

Using the `nmp` CLI, complete the following:

1. Confirm the mock model is available by listing models or providers in the default workspace
2. Make a non-streaming chat completion request to `default/chat-model` with a user message (e.g., "What is the capital of France?")
3. Make a streaming chat completion request to the same model with a different user message

Note: Streaming may not be fully supported by the mock provider - if streaming fails, that is acceptable as long as you attempted it.

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
- You have confirmed the mock model is available
- At least one chat completion request returned a response from the model
