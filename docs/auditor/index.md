# About Auditing Models

!!! important "{{__auditor_long_name}} is released with _early access_ availability and is subject to limited support and potential API changes in future releases."

{{__auditor_long_name}} audits LLMs by probing them with adversarial prompts and detecting failures such as jailbreaks, prompt injection, encoding bypasses, and unsafe output generation.
It is powered by [garak](https://github.com/NVIDIA/garak), NVIDIA's open-source LLM vulnerability scanner, and integrates with {{platform_name}} so audits can target any model reachable through the Inference Gateway.

## Typical Workflow

A typical audit looks like the following:

1. Create an [audit target](targets/index.md) for the model you want to test.
1. Create an [audit configuration](configs/index.md) that selects which garak probes and detectors to run, along with reporting settings.
1. [Run the audit](tutorials/run-audit-locally.md) and inspect the resulting JSONL, HTML, and hitlog reports.

The plugin exposes both [synchronous and asynchronous](sdk-resources.md) Python entry points for each step.

## Setup

Before you can run audits, you need a working {{platform_name}} install with the auditor plugin enabled and a garak interpreter on disk.

- Follow [Setup](../get-started/setup.md) to install the platform and start local services.
- Install garak in a Python virtual environment. By default the plugin invokes `~/.auditor/.venv/bin/python -m garak`; override the interpreter path with `NEMO_AUDITOR_GARAK_PYTHON` if you installed it elsewhere.
- Configure at least one [Inference Gateway provider](../run-inference/about.md) so audits can route requests to the model under test.

## Task Guides

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[Audit Targets](targets/index.md)**

    ---

    Define the model under test — generator type, model identifier, and inference endpoint.

-   **[Audit Configurations](configs/index.md)**

    ---

    Choose probes, detectors, and reporting settings for the audit.

-   **[Run an Audit Locally](tutorials/run-audit-locally.md)**

    ---

    End-to-end walkthrough: create entities, run the audit in-process, read the report artifacts.

-   **[SDK Resources](sdk-resources.md)**

    ---

    Reference for the `client.auditor` SDK surface: `configs`, `targets`, and `run()`.

## References

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **[Configuration Schema](configs/schema.md)**

    ---

    Field reference for `AuditConfig` and its `system`, `run`, `plugins`, and `reporting` sub-models.

-   **[Target Schema](targets/schema.md)**

    ---

    Field reference for `AuditTarget` (`type`, `model`, `options`).

-   **[Selecting Probes](configs/probes.md)**

    ---

    `probe_spec`, `probe_tags`, and `detector_spec` syntax with worked examples.

-   **[Inference Gateway](targets/inference-gateway.md)**
