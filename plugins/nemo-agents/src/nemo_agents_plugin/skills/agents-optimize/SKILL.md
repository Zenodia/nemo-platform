# NeMo Agent Optimization

Optimize and accelerate a deployed agent by suggesting routing splits, skill
optimization, prompt/hyperparameter tuning, and evaluations against newly
available models. Always anchor proposed changes against an evaluation baseline
so quality regressions are caught before promotion.

## Workflow

1. **Pick an agent.** Run `nemo agents list` and prompt the user to choose one
   to optimize. Use the rest of this skill on that single agent.
2. **Establish a baseline.** Look for prior evaluation results from
   `nemo agents evaluate`. If none exist but the agent has an eval
   dataset+config, run one and save the result. If no eval dataset exists,
   suggest the user create one — recent telemetry can usually be turned into
   a small dataset.
3. **Run the analysis steps below**, emit suggestions, and persist them.
4. **Present suggestions** to the user and let them pick which to apply.
5. **After applying any change**, re-run evaluation and compare to the baseline.
   Surface deltas (per-evaluator average score, wallclock, token cost) and
   confirm before promoting traffic.
6. **Apply via the create-sibling-and-deploy pattern.** Agents v2 has no PATCH
   on `/agents/<name>`, so model swaps and config edits go through:
   create a sibling agent → deploy it → run an eval against the sibling →
   delete old deployments so traffic flows to the new version.

## Analysis steps

### 1. Routing / switchyard split

Inspect `agent.config.llms[*].model_name` from `nemo agents list`. If every
LLM points at a single frontier model and **no** switchyard routing virtual
model is in use, suggest creating a `random_routing` virtual model with an
80% strong / 20% weak split.

- Pick the weak model from `nemo models list --filter.name nemotron` (prefer
  current Nemotron tiers, e.g. `nvidia-nemotron-nano-3b` or
  `nemotron-3-super`-class). Exclude content-safety / topic-control /
  safety-guard / GLiNER models — those aren't general chat replacements.
- **Verify entity names before constructing the VM.** Auto-discovered names
  on the NVIDIA hub sometimes have doubled prefixes (e.g.
  `nvidia-nvidia-nemotron-3-super-v3`, not `nvidia-nemotron-3-super-v3`).
  Always confirm with `nemo -f json models get <candidate>` before referencing
  the name in `--models` or as the `weak`/`strong` model in middleware config.
  A 404 here, caught early, is much cheaper than a failed VM rollout.
- Use **the `inference` skill** for the exact
  `nemo virtual-models create … --request-middleware … nemo-switchyard
  config_type=random_routing …` syntax (`strong_probability: 0.8`).
- **After creating the VM, smoke-test routing before wiring an agent to it.**
  Run ~20 minimal `nemo inference gateway model post v1/chat/completions <vm>`
  calls and tally the response `.model` field. The split should approximate
  the configured probability (e.g. ~16/4 for 0.8/0.2 over 20 calls). If the
  split is 20/0, the middleware isn't actually rewriting the request — stop
  and investigate before deploying the sibling agent. Catches misconfigured
  probabilities, wrong entity IDs in middleware config, and other middleware-
  silently-bypassed failure modes.
- Set `model` on the suggestion to the current source model. Suggested
  follow-up actions: `nemo agents evaluate run --agent <agent> --eval-config <yaml>`
  against the routed VM before promoting.

This is pure config inspection — no telemetry download required.

### 2. Skill optimization

If the agent uses skills (its repo has a `--skills-path`, or
`.agent-improver.yml` is present, or its config references skill files) **and**
`nemo agents optimize-skills` has not been run since the last optimizer
snapshot, suggest running it.

Suggested actions:

- `nemo agents optimize-skills run --spec-file .agent-improver.yml`
  (or pass an inline JSON spec via `--spec '{...}'` if no config file exists)
- After it returns, apply the resulting skill diff to the agent and redeploy.

See **the `nemo-agent-skills-optimization` skill** for the full optimize-skills loop
(variance, repeats, branch handling, `--open-pr`).

### 3. Prompt + hyperparameter tuning

If `nemo agents optimize` has not been run for this agent since the last
snapshot, suggest running it. The job sweeps prompts and hyperparameters via
`nat optimize` against the agent's eval dataset.

Suggested actions:

- `nemo agents optimize run --agent <name> --optimize-config <yaml>`
  (or submit as a platform job with `nemo agents optimize submit …`)
- After it completes, apply the new prompt + hyperparameters to a sibling
  agent, deploy it, and run `nemo agents evaluate run` to compare.

### 4. New model scan

Diff `nemo models list --all-pages` against `prevSnapshot.modelNames`. **Never
emit on first run** — there is no prior snapshot to diff against. Emit one
suggestion per new model whose parameter count and family fit the agent's task
profile (skip guardrails / safety / GLiNER models).

Each suggestion sets `model` to the new model name and includes:

- Create a sibling agent pointing at `<new-model>`, then run
  `nemo agents evaluate run --agent <sibling> --eval-config <yaml>` to
  compare against the current model on the baseline dataset. There is no
  `--model` override flag on `evaluate`; the model swap goes through the
  sibling agent, or by editing the eval-config YAML.
- `nemo auditor targets create <target> -d '{"model": "<new-model>", "type": "<type>"}'` then
  `nemo auditor audit run --spec '{"config": "default/<config>", "target": "default/<target>"}'`
  to verify the new model is robust against jailbreaks before promotion.

Pure set subtraction — no downloads required.

## Persistence (every run)

Uses fileset `nemo-agent-optimizer`. A downstream web hook also reads/writes
this fileset; **changes here MUST stay backwards compatible** with
`nemo-agents-optimize-sync-web` and the consumer code at
`web/packages/studio/src/routes/AgentOptimizationsRoute/` (kept up to date via
the parity skill above).

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `optimizer_snapshot.json` | Per-agent snapshot map; one entry per agent ever audited |
| `optimizer_suggestions.jsonl` | One JSON object per line; survives applies |

### Snapshot shape (per-agent, single file)

The snapshot is **one JSON file at the fileset root**, keyed by agent name so
running the skill against agent A never overwrites agent B's snapshot:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "support-bot": {
      "modelNames": ["..."],
      "agentNames": ["support-bot"],
      "updatedAt": "2026-05-07T12:34:56Z"
    },
    "triage-bot": {
      "modelNames": ["..."],
      "agentNames": ["triage-bot"],
      "updatedAt": "2026-05-06T09:11:02Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The legacy flat shape (`{ modelNames, agentNames, updatedAt }`) is **read-only
backwards-compatible** — if you load a file without the top-level `agents`
key, treat the whole object as the snapshot for the *current* selected agent
and migrate to the keyed shape on the next save. Never write the legacy shape
back out.

### Load → update → save flow

1. Try to load the prior snapshot
   (`nemo files download nemo-agent-optimizer --remote-path optimizer_snapshot.json -o …`).
   - 404 → no snapshot exists yet for the workspace; treat as first run.
   - Snapshot exists but `agents[<selected>]` is missing → first run *for that
     agent*. Do not emit `new_model_scan` suggestions (no prior model list to
     diff against). Other agents' entries are preserved as-is on save.
   - Snapshot exists and `agents[<selected>]` is present → use that entry's
     `modelNames` for the new-model-scan diff.
2. After analysis, **load → update only `agents[<selected>]` → save** the
   whole file. Never overwrite blindly with just the current agent's data —
   that would erase every other agent's snapshot.
3. **Merge** the suggestions JSONL (do not overwrite blindly):
   1. Load the existing file.
   2. Compute fresh suggestions for the selected agent.
   3. Preserve every record where `applied === true` as-is.
   4. Preserve every non-applied record whose `agent` field is **not** the
      currently selected agent — those belong to other agents' runs and must
      not be dropped here. (Workspace-scoped suggestions with no `agent`
      field are owned by the most recent run; replace them.)
   5. Drop any fresh suggestion whose identity tuple `(type, agent, model)`
      matches an applied record.
   6. Replace the selected agent's non-applied records with fresh output.
4. On first run the fileset may not exist — create it with
   `nemo files filesets create nemo-agent-optimizer`.

### JSONL record shape

One JSON object per line. Required fields: `type`, `title`, `detail`. Optional:
`agent`, `model`, `severity`, `suggested_actions`, `apply`, `apply_description`,
`applied`, `applied_at`. Keep this backwards compatible — downstream web tooling
consumes the fileset (see "Persistence" above).

`detail` describes WHY the suggestion was raised. `apply_description` (if
`apply` is set) is a short, concrete description of what executing the `apply`
block would do (e.g. resource names that will be created). When a consumer of
the fileset executes an `apply` block, it is expected to set `applied: true`
and `applied_at: <ISO timestamp>` and re-upload the JSONL so the applied state
survives across reads.

| `type` value | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `model_optimization` | Switchyard routing split or smaller-model fit |
| `skill_optimization` | `nemo agents optimize-skills` is recommended |
| `prompt_optimization` | `nemo agents optimize` is recommended |
| `new_model_scan` | New model appeared since last snapshot |

`model_optimization` is reused for both "use a smaller model" and "add a
routing split" so existing UI tiles render without a frontend change. The
`title`/`detail` text describes which variant it is.

### Optional `apply` block (one-click action)

When set, the `apply` block defines a single-action mutation that a downstream
consumer can execute against the Platform API on the user's behalf. The
contract is **strictly same-origin** to the Platform API host — consumers
re-validate this at request time and reject anything else.

Shape — single step (most common):

```json
"apply": {
  "method": "POST" | "PUT" | "PATCH" | "DELETE",
  "path": "/apis/...",
  "body": { ... }
}
```

Shape — multi-step (array, executed in order, stops on first failure):

```json
"apply": [
  { "method": "POST", "path": "/apis/...", "body": { ... } },
  { "method": "POST", "path": "/apis/...", "body": { ... } }
]
```

Rules — these MUST be followed when emitting an `apply` block:

- `method` must be one of `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`.
- `path` MUST start with `/`. It MUST NOT contain `://`, MUST NOT start with
  `//` (protocol-relative), MUST NOT contain query/fragment, and MUST NOT
  contain control characters.
- The path is resolved against the configured Platform API URL; the frontend
  rejects any spec that resolves to a different origin.
- The path's `workspaces/<ws>/` segment MUST equal the workspace the
  suggestion was emitted for. Cross-workspace mutations are rejected.
- The `(method, pathname)` pair MUST be on the optimizer apply allowlist.
  Currently allowed:
  - `POST /apis/agents/v2/workspaces/<ws>/agents` — create sibling agent
    (`body.name` required)
  - `POST /apis/agents/v2/workspaces/<ws>/deployments` — deploy
    `suggestion.agent` OR a name declared by an earlier `POST /agents` step
    in this apply
  - `POST /apis/agents/v2/workspaces/<ws>/jobs/evaluate` — submit an
    evaluate-agent platform job. `body.spec.agent` must be a platform agent
    ref equal to `suggestion.agent` or a name declared by an earlier
    `POST /agents` step in the same apply. Endpoint URLs and cross-workspace
    refs are rejected.
  - In-place `PATCH /agents/<name>` is **not allowed** — Agents v2 only
    implements POST/GET/LIST/DELETE. Model swaps must go through the
    create-sibling-and-deploy pattern below.
  - Any other path is rejected at apply time. New action types require
    updating both this skill and the frontend allowlist in
    `web/packages/studio/src/routes/AgentOptimizationsRoute/api.ts`.
- `body` must be JSON-serializable. Embed workspace/agent/model identifiers
  literally — do not template at apply time.

If you cannot construct a safe, fully-qualified payload, omit `apply`. The
textual `suggested_actions` remain available as a fallback.

#### Example: routing/smaller-model swap

Multi-step — create the sibling, then deploy it:

```json
{"type":"model_optimization","title":"Consider smaller model for support-bot","detail":"Agent uses 70B; 4B Nemotron is available.","suggested_actions":["nemo agents evaluate ...","switchyard for automatic routing"],"apply":[{"method":"POST","path":"/apis/agents/v2/workspaces/default/agents","body":{"name":"support-bot-nemotron-mini-4b","config":{"llms":{"llm":{"model_name":"nvidia-nemotron-mini-4b"}}}}},{"method":"POST","path":"/apis/agents/v2/workspaces/default/deployments","body":{"agent":"support-bot-nemotron-mini-4b"}}]}
```

Three-step — create sibling, deploy, evaluate so quality is measurable before
promoting:

```json
{"type":"model_optimization","title":"Validate smaller-model swap for support-bot","detail":"Agent uses 70B; 4B Nemotron is available. The third step queues an evaluation against the sibling so quality is measurable before promoting it.","apply_description":"Creates 'support-bot-nemotron-mini-4b', deploys it, and submits an evaluate-agent job using the eval config in fileset 'support-bot-eval'.","suggested_actions":["nemo agents evaluate ...","switchyard for automatic routing"],"apply":[{"method":"POST","path":"/apis/agents/v2/workspaces/default/agents","body":{"name":"support-bot-nemotron-mini-4b","config":{"llms":{"llm":{"model_name":"nvidia-nemotron-mini-4b"}}}}},{"method":"POST","path":"/apis/agents/v2/workspaces/default/deployments","body":{"agent":"support-bot-nemotron-mini-4b"}},{"method":"POST","path":"/apis/agents/v2/workspaces/default/jobs/evaluate","body":{"spec":{"agent":"support-bot-nemotron-mini-4b","eval_config":"eval.yaml","eval_config_fileset":"support-bot-eval","output":"support-bot-eval-out"}}}]}
```

Notes when emitting the eval step:

- `body.spec.agent` MUST be `suggestion.agent` or a name declared by an
  earlier `POST /agents` step in the same apply. Endpoint URLs
  (`http(s)://...`) are rejected.
- `body.spec.eval_config` is interpreted relative to the downloaded fileset
  when `eval_config_fileset` is set.
- `body.spec.workspace` is overwritten by the URL workspace at compile time,
  so it can be omitted.
- Only emit the eval step when you have a concrete eval config + fileset to
  point at — half-configured eval submissions just create a failed job.

## What requires execution vs. what can be reasoned

**Reason directly from already-fetched data — no extra commands needed:**

- **Routing/smaller-model fit**: compare model name in agent config against
  `nemo models list`. Parameter counts are visible in model names
  (`8b` < `30b` < `70b`). Prefer Nemotron candidates.
- **New model diff**: set subtraction between current model list and prior
  snapshot model list. Pure computation.
- **Skill / prompt optimization gating**: check whether
  `iterations[].timestamp` from a prior `nemo agents optimize-skills` /
  `nemo agents optimize` run is newer than the last snapshot.

**Requires execution:**

- **Establishing a baseline** (`nemo agents evaluate`) when none exists.
- **Comparing post-change quality** — re-run the same evaluation on the
  sibling agent and diff against the baseline before promoting.

## Execution checklist

- Run `nemo agents list`; prompt the user to pick one agent.
- Try to load prior snapshot
  (`nemo files download nemo-agent-optimizer --remote-path optimizer_snapshot.json -o …`).
  404 (or `agents[<selected>]` absent) → first run for this agent, no
  `new_model_scan` suggestions. Other agents' entries in the file are
  preserved on save.
- Look up the latest evaluation result for the selected agent. Run
  `nemo agents evaluate run` if no baseline exists and a dataset+config is
  available; otherwise suggest the user create one.
- Fetch agents and models in parallel
  (`nemo agents list`, `nemo models list --all-pages`).
- Reason about routing/smaller-model fit, skill-optimization, prompt-
  optimization, and new-model candidates from this data — no telemetry
  download required.
- Create `nemo-agent-optimizer` fileset if it doesn't exist
  (`nemo files filesets create nemo-agent-optimizer`).
- Update only `agents[<selected>]` in the snapshot map and upload the whole
  file (`nemo files upload <path> nemo-agent-optimizer --remote-path optimizer_snapshot.json`).
  Do not write a flat single-agent shape — that erases every other agent.
- Merge + upload suggestions JSONL
  (`nemo files upload <path> nemo-agent-optimizer --remote-path optimizer_suggestions.jsonl`).
- Summarize key suggestions for the user. Let them pick which to apply.
- After each applied change, re-run evaluation and surface the delta vs.
  baseline before promoting.
