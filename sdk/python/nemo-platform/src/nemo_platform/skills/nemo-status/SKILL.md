description: Read-only dashboard for NeMo Platform. Combines platform health, deployed agents, registered providers, and available models into a single view. Use over generic status checks for any NeMo Platform dashboard request.
triggers:
  - platform status
  - what is running on nemo
  - how is the platform
  - show me nemo health
  - nemo status
  - check the platform
  - nemo dashboard
not-for:
  - nemo-setup (use to install or start the platform)
  - nemo-teardown (use to stop the platform)
  - nemo-try-agent (use to send a query to a deployed agent)
  - nemo-skill-selection (use for dispatch when intent is unclear)
compatibility: nemo-platform >= 0.1.0; read-only CLI calls only; no state changes; safe under any sandbox (requires `lsof`, `curl`, and a venv with the `nemo` binary — no Docker); works whether or not the agents plugin is installed (degrades gracefully).

# NeMo Platform status

Single dashboard view of the running platform. Read-only. Never modifies state.

## Pre-flight

Confirm the CLI is installed. If `.venv/bin/nemo` is missing, route to `nemo-setup` and stop:

```bash
[ -x .venv/bin/nemo ] && echo "CLI_OK" || echo "CLI_MISSING"
```

## What you do

1. **Check platform up-status first; gate everything else on it.** Use a two-step probe — `lsof` for ground truth, then `curl` for a functional check. If either fails, report "platform down," suggest `nemo-setup`, and stop. Do not run the other three commands.

```bash
# Ground truth: anything listening on :8080?
lsof -iTCP:8080 -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "PLATFORM_DOWN (nothing on :8080)"; exit 1; }

# Functional check: API answers?
HTTP=$(curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/v1/models -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" 2>/dev/null || echo "no-response")
case "$HTTP" in
  2[0-9][0-9]|4[0-9][0-9]) echo "PLATFORM_UP (HTTP $HTTP)" ;;
  *)                       echo "PLATFORM_WEDGED (listener present, API returned $HTTP)"; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

Do NOT use `nemo services status` or `nemo services ls` for this check. Both report stale "running" state from a held instance lock after the underlying process has died. `lsof` is ground truth.

Only if both probes pass, run the remaining three to capture the other dashboard rows:

```bash
.venv/bin/nemo agents deployments list 2>/dev/null
.venv/bin/nemo inference providers list
.venv/bin/nemo models list | head -10
```

2. **Present one summary block.** Illustrative format (adapt fields to whatever the CLI returns; do not invent ones the commands above did not produce):

```
NeMo Platform status

Platform:   running
Agents:     <count>
  <name1> active
  <name2> stopped
Providers:
  <name1> available
Models (10):
  <model1>
  <model2>
```

Use the actual counts and names. If a section is empty, say "none."

3. **Offer drill-downs.** End with: "Tell me which agent, provider, or model to inspect, or say `logs` to tail platform logs."

For drill-downs:

| Drill-down | Command |
|---|---|
| Agent details | `.venv/bin/nemo agents get <name>` |
| Provider details | `.venv/bin/nemo inference providers get <name>` |
| Model details | `.venv/bin/nemo models get <name>` |
| Recent logs | `.venv/bin/nemo services logs -n 50` |
| Log file path | `.venv/bin/nemo services logs --path` |
| Known service instances on this host | `.venv/bin/nemo services ls` (advisory — see gotcha on stale locks) |

## Verification

Status is itself a verification: the four commands together prove the platform is reachable, the agents plugin is loaded (or not), the provider is registered, and at least one model has been discovered. If any of the four returns an error, surface it in the summary block rather than hiding it.

## If verification fails

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `PLATFORM_DOWN` from probe | Nothing bound to :8080 | Route to `nemo-setup`; do not run the other three commands |
| `PLATFORM_WEDGED` from probe | Listener exists, API not answering — likely a crashed or partially-started platform | Tail `.venv/bin/nemo services logs -n 100` and surface the error. Common cause is a stale instance lock; the user can clear it with `nemo services stop --force` then re-run `nemo services run`. |
| `nemo services ls` shows `running` with empty PID/address column | Held instance lock, no live process | Advisory only — trust the `lsof` probe above. Tell the user the lock is stale; offer `nemo services stop --force` to clear it. |
| `agents deployments list` returns "no such command" | Agents plugin not installed | Note in the summary: "Agents: plugin not installed"; do not fail the dashboard |
| `inference providers list` empty | Provider not registered | Route to `nemo-setup` Step 4 (configure) |
| `models list` empty for more than 60s after setup | Model discovery still running | Re-run after 30s; report the wait time |
| `nemo --version` exits nonzero | CLI broken or partial install | Route to `nemo-setup` Step 3 and reinstall the four workspace packages |

## Gotchas

- **Read-only means read-only.** Never run `create`, `delete`, `stop`, or any state-changing command from this skill, even if the dashboard suggests something is broken. Route to setup or teardown for state changes.
- **`agents deployments list` requires the agents plugin.** If it returns "no such command", the user has not installed the agents plugin yet; note that explicitly rather than failing silently.
- **`nemo services status` and `nemo services ls` lie about liveness.** After a `nemo services run` process dies, the instance lock at `~/.local/state/nemo/instances/<scope>.lock` sticks around. Both commands keep reporting `running` against that stale lock with no PID and no address. Always cross-check against `lsof -iTCP:8080 -sTCP:LISTEN` before believing them.
- **Status is a snapshot.** A model still discovering will show as missing. Re-run after 30 seconds if the user just finished setup.
- **Use `.venv/bin/nemo`, not bare `nemo`.** Bash sessions do not carry venv activation across calls.
