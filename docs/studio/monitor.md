# {{studio_short_name}} Monitor

Use {{studio_short_name}} **Agents > Monitor** to inspect recent agent activity for the selected workspace.

## Telemetry Source

{{studio_short_name}} reads agent telemetry from the `nemo-agent-telemetry` fileset. Each telemetry file contributes run summaries, token usage, and request metadata that {{studio_short_name}} aggregates for the Monitor page.

## Summary Cards

The Monitor page summarizes recent runs across the available telemetry files. Use the agent filter to focus the page on one or more agents.

## Token Usage

The token usage chart shows recent token consumption from the loaded telemetry files. Use it to spot agents or time windows that are driving unusually high usage.

## Inference Logs

The inference logs table shows recent agent requests from the loaded telemetry files. Use it to inspect agent names, timing, token counts, and request status while debugging agent behavior.
