@contextmanager
def auth_as_service(service: Optional[str] = None) -> Generator[None, None, None]:
    """Context manager to run code with service principal credentials.

    Creates a new AuthClient with service principal credentials and sets it
    in the context variable. This isolates the elevated credentials to the
    current async context without affecting concurrent code.

    The service principal (e.g., "service:auth") has elevated permissions in the
    OPA policy, allowing internal service-to-service calls.

    This can be used both within request handlers (where auth context exists)
    and in background tasks/startup code (where it creates a fresh context).

    Note:
        Currently all service principals are treated equally with full permissions.
        In the future, service principals may be restricted based on scope - e.g.,
        "service:evaluator" would not have access to data designer resources.

    Args:
        service: Service name for the principal (e.g., "evaluator").
                 Defaults to the current client's configured service name, or
                 "unknown" if no context exists and no service is specified.

        from nmp.common.auth import auth_as_service
