# Safe Synthesizer Artifacts

## Prerequisites

- NeMo CLI access through `nemo` or `uv run nemo`; use the repo version from this branch or newer.
- Workspace access to the job and result filesets for platform artifacts.
- `config.evaluation.enabled` must be `true` for evaluation reports to be produced.
- A synthesis run must train and save an adapter for `adapter` artifacts to exist.

## Interpreting Outputs

- `synthetic-data.csv`: generated or processed tabular data.
- `summary.json`: run summary and timing metadata.
- `evaluation-report.html`: optional evaluation report when enabled and produced.
- `adapter/`: optional adapter output when training produces one.
- `summary`
- `synthetic-data`
- `evaluation-report`
- `adapter`
- `summary` / `summary.json`: use this first for row counts, timing, and high-level run status.
- `synthetic-data`: final CSV data. For PII-only runs this may be processed data rather than newly synthesized records.
- `evaluation-report`: HTML report if evaluation was enabled and completed.
- `adapter`: model adapter artifacts, present only for runs that train and save an adapter.

## Missing Artifacts

- If `evaluation-report` is missing, confirm `config.evaluation.enabled` and check whether the runtime produced `evaluation_report_html`.
- If `adapter` is missing, confirm the run trained a model and produced an adapter path.
- If `synthetic-data` is missing, treat it as a failed run and inspect job or local logs first.

## Next Steps

- Retrieve result files with `workflows/results.md`.
- Check evaluation and adapter settings in `workflows/config.md`.
- Start artifact inspection with `summary` or `summary.json`.
- Debug missing outputs with `workflows/diagnose.md`.
