"""Middleware config entity for the example inference middleware plugin.

Stores the configuration for :class:`~nemo_example_plugin.middleware.ExampleInferenceMiddleware`.
A ``MiddlewareCall`` in a VirtualModel can reference this entity via ``config_id``
(``"workspace/my-filter-config"``) instead of embedding the config inline.

Referencing by ``config_id`` means:

- The config is stored and versioned in the entity store.
- Multiple VirtualModels can share the same config.
- Updating the config entity triggers IGW to re-resolve and cache the new config
  for every VirtualModel that references it — no VirtualModel edit required.
- The config must have its own CRUD API (see
  :mod:`nemo_example_plugin.middleware_service`) so operators can create and
  update it.

If all your configs are simple and don't need versioning or sharing, use inline
config (``MiddlewareCall.config``) and skip the entity + CRUD API entirely.
