!!! note
    The platform pre-configures a `system/nvidia-build` model provider during startup.
    This provider routes inference requests to models hosted on `build.nvidia.com` using the API base URL `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com`
    and the NGC API key with `Public API Endpoints` permissions provided during deployment (automatically saved as the built-in `system/ngc-api-key` secret).

    You can verify this provider exists by running `nemo inference providers list --workspace system`.

    The tutorials in these docs use this provider for inference, but you can alternatively create your own and use it instead.
