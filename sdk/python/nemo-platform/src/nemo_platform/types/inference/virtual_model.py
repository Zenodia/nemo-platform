class VirtualModel(BaseModel):
    """Logical inference route.

    Maps a user-facing model name to an optional default model entity and
    defines ordered middleware pipelines for the request, response, and
    post-response phases.

    When a caller sets ``model: "workspace/my-virtual-model"`` in an inference
    request, IGW resolves the ``VirtualModel`` instead of a ``ModelEntity``
    directly. If ``default_model_entity`` is set, IGW writes it into
    ``request["model"]`` before the request middleware pipeline runs. Middleware
    may mutate ``request["model"]`` freely. After the pipeline completes, IGW
    reads ``request["model"]``, resolves it to a ``ModelProvider`` via the
    ``ModelCache``, and proxies.

    The ``ModelProviderReconciler`` auto-creates a passthrough ``VirtualModel``
    for each discovered model (same workspace and name as the ``ModelEntity``,
    empty middleware lists, ``default_model_entity`` pointing to that entity).
    All existing inference requests continue to work without changes.
