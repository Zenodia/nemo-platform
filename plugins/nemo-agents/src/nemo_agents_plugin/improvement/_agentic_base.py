"""Shared agentic-base image build helper.

Both the Harbor runner (Claude Code AUT) and the NAT runner (NeMo Agent
Toolkit AUT) inherit from the same ``nmp-agentic-base:latest`` Docker image.
This module owns the image name and the build helper so both runners go
through one path; previously the helper lived on the Harbor runner and the
NAT runner silently depended on Harbor having been run first to populate
the image.
