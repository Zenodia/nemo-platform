# LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation (CLI)

You have access to the `nemo` CLI for NeMo Platform operations. Note: MCP tools are not available in this environment - you must use the CLI.

The `nemo` CLI is available at `/app/.venv/bin/nemo`. Use `nemo --help` and subcommand `--help` flags to discover available commands and their options. The CLI connects to the local NeMo Platform API server at http://localhost:8080 by default.

## Context

- CLI authentication is pre-configured (already logged in)
- A workspace named `eval-judge-workspace` is pre-configured
- An inference API key is available in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

## Task

Set up and run an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation via the `nemo` CLI.

1. **Create a secret** named `nvidia-api-key` in the `eval-judge-workspace` workspace containing the value of `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

2. **Prepare and upload a dataset** - Create a JSONL file with `input` and `output` fields. Include at least one poor-quality response. Upload it as a fileset named `judge-eval-dataset` in `eval-judge-workspace`.

3. **Create an LLM-as-a-Judge metric** named `quality-judge` in `eval-judge-workspace` with these requirements:
   - Type: `llm-judge`
   - Model: `nvidia/openai/gpt-oss-20b` via direct inference at `https://inference-api.nvidia.com/v1`, openai format, using the `nvidia-api-key` secret
   - A score named `relevance` with range 1-5, using a JSON parser to extract the `relevance` field
   - A messages-format prompt template that asks the judge to rate responses and return JSON

4. **Run a synchronous evaluation** using `quality-judge` against a small inline dataset (2-3 rows). The sync eval returns immediate per-row scores.

5. **Examine the scored results** - Verify each row got a relevance score in 1-5 range and that good responses scored higher than poor ones.

6. **Create a metric evaluation job** referencing `quality-judge` and `judge-eval-dataset`. It may stay in "created" status - that is expected.

7. **Check the job status** to confirm it was created.
