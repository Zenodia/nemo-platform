"""Module-level state mapping VirtualModels to registered Switchyard factories.

NOTE: Module-level state is necessary because the nemo_platform_plugin interface passes only
config_type in middleware_config (not the full config or factory_name), so we need
a lookup keyed by (vm_key, config_type, phase). IGW has its own caching layer but
doesn't expose it for this purpose. State is cleared on shutdown to prevent stale
entries on reload.

Phase tagging: each switchyard config is associated with the phase the user listed
it under — "request" if it's in `request_middleware`, "response" if in
`response_middleware`. process_request looks up only request-phase entries;
process_response only response-phase entries. Listing the same config under both
lists registers two phase entries pointing at the same factory — the user is
explicitly opting into both pipelines.

Concurrency caveat: check-then-set in on_virtual_model_upserted is not atomic.
Multiple parallel upserts of identical configs could both miss and attempt register().
For now, assumes single-threaded startup; revisit if concurrency becomes an issue.
