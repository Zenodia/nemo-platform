"""``MiddlewareFactory`` registry — typed config -> request/response pipelines.

A ``MiddlewareFactory`` bridges declarative config (an entity-store
payload, a NeMo Platform VirtualModel descriptor, a CLI flag bundle) to a pair of
:class:`RequestPipeline` / :class:`ResponsePipeline`. Hosts that own
their own LLM backend — NeMo Platform IGW today, possibly Studio / Evaluator
later — look up a factory by name, validate their raw config through it,
and slot the resulting pipelines around their backend.

Factories are deliberately host-agnostic: they live in
``switchyard/lib/factories/``, they don't know about IGW or NeMo Platform, and
the same registry is usable from the Switchyard CLI / standalone
server. NeMo Platform-specific concerns (IGW ``ModelProvider`` resolution,
request-id keying, etc.) belong to the bridge layer, not here.

Discovery uses the ``switchyard.middlewares`` entry-point group.
Each entry-point is a module path; importing the module triggers a
``register(...)`` side-effect inside the module.

    The protocol is split into four part-builders so consumers only pay
    for what they use:

    * NeMo Platform IGW supplies its own backend — it calls
      :meth:`build_request_pipeline` / :meth:`build_response_pipeline`
      and never instantiates an LLM client.
    * Standalone Switchyard (CLI, recipes) calls
      :meth:`MiddlewareBundle.from_factory` which invokes all four
      part-builders to assemble a full chain.

    Implementations should:

    * Set ``name`` to a unique string — the registry key.
    * Set ``config_class`` to the pydantic model that describes their
      configuration.
    * Implement ``validate(raw)`` to coerce a dict / pre-validated model
      into the typed config (raises ``pydantic.ValidationError`` on
      malformed input).
    * Implement :meth:`build_request_pipeline` and
      :meth:`build_response_pipeline` — every factory ships processors
      (the pipeline may be empty).
    * Optionally implement :meth:`build_backend` and
      :meth:`build_translator` — return ``None`` when the host owns
      these slots. :class:`BaseMiddlewareFactory` provides the
      ``return None`` defaults so pure middleware factories don't need
      to write them by hand.
