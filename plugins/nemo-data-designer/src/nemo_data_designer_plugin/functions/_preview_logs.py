"""Per-request log forwarding for ``data_designer`` library logs.

The :class:`PreviewHandler` is attached idempotently to the ``data_designer``
logger on first use and stays attached. It reads the per-request callback
from a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar`, which is task-local — so concurrent
preview requests in the FastAPI service don't cross-talk: each task's handler
emit reads its own callback and pushes frames into its own stream.
