# Manage Customization Jobs

<a id="ft-manage-customization-jobs"></a>
Use customization jobs to fine-tune a [model](../models/index.md) using a [dataset](../../get-started/concepts/manage-files.md) and [hyperparameters](hyperparameters.md).

## How It Works

Customization jobs reference a **Model Entity** that contains the base model checkpoint. When training completes:

-   **LoRA jobs**: Create an **Adapter** attached to the original Model Entity. Adapters can be auto-deployed to NIMs.
-   **Full fine-tuning jobs**: Create a **new Model Entity** with the customized weights, linked to the base model.

This design keeps adapters organized with their parent models and simplifies deployment workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before you can customize a model using a customization job, make sure that you have `prepared and uploaded a dataset <../tutorials/format-training-dataset>` to the dataset repository. See also [format-training-dataset](../tutorials/format-training-dataset.md) for dataset formatting requirements.

## Task Guides

Perform common customization job tasks.

!!! tip
    The value for `NMP_BASE_URL` will depend on your deployment. After the standard [Setup](../../get-started/setup.md) flow, the default local URL is `http://localhost:8080`. Otherwise, consult with your cluster administrator.
