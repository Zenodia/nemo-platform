    Passed to :meth:`NemoInferenceMiddleware.process_request` and returned from it.
    Plugins may mutate ``body``, ``headers``, and ``path`` in-place and return
    ``self``, or construct a new instance — either style is valid.

    All three fields are required. When constructing a new instance instead of
    mutating in-place, always copy ``path`` from the incoming request::

        # correct
        return InferenceRequest(
            body={**request.body, "model": chosen},
            headers=request.headers,
            path=request.path,
        )

    Omitting ``path`` is a compile-time error. This prevents the silent 404
    that would result from sending the request to the backend root URL.

    ``typed_body`` does not need to be copied or re-derived manually when
    constructing a new instance. IGW automatically re-derives ``typed_body``
    from ``body`` and ``path`` between every plugin in the request middleware
    chain, so the next plugin always receives a fresh, consistent typed view
    regardless of what the previous plugin returned.

    Attributes:
        body: OpenAI-compatible request body dict (e.g. ``{"model": ..., "messages": [...]}``.
            When called, ``body["model"]`` contains the model entity written by IGW from
            ``VirtualModel.default_model_entity`` (if set). Middleware may freely rewrite it.
        headers: HTTP request headers forwarded to each plugin in the chain.
        path: Backend-relative path (e.g. ``"v1/chat/completions"``). IGW sets the
            initial value from the incoming request URI. Middleware may rewrite this to
            any arbitrary path and IGW will proxy to that path instead.
        typed_body: SDK-typed view of the request body validated against the TypedDict
            schema for this path. ``None`` when the path is unknown or body validation
            fails.

            Mirrors ``InferenceResponse.typed_body``: just as
            ``response.typed_body`` is the typed view of ``result``,
            ``request.typed_body`` is the typed view of ``body``.

            All three SDK request param types are TypedDicts — plain dicts at runtime.
            This field is validated by IGW before the request middleware chain runs.
            Plugins that need cross-format awareness read ``request.path`` to determine
            format and use this as a type-checked alias for ``body``.

            Parsed non-fatally: a body that fails TypedDict validation is not an error
            — the plugin receives ``typed_body=None`` and falls back to ``body`` or
            raises a descriptive error as needed.

    Passed to :meth:`NemoInferenceMiddleware.process_response` and returned from it.
    Plugins may mutate the canonical response view plus ``headers`` in-place and
    return ``self``, or construct a new instance — either style is valid.
    ``typed_body`` is populated by IGW when it can parse the payload for the
    resolved backend format.

    Canonical response contract: for non-streaming responses, when
    ``typed_body`` is not ``None``, it is the canonical response view and IGW
    serializes it instead of ``result``. Streaming ``typed_body`` is a
    middleware-only typed view; IGW serializes the raw ``result`` stream. When
    ``typed_body`` is ``None``, ``result`` is canonical. Middleware should
    mutate exactly one canonical view. IGW does not keep ``result`` and
    ``typed_body`` synchronized between plugins.

    Plugins can manipulate the response payload or headers in the following ways:

    - Mutate existing payload fields (for example, redact
      ``choices[0].message.content``) by mutating ``typed_body`` when available,
      or ``result`` when no typed view exists.
    - Add new top-level response fields (for example, guardrails metadata)
      by writing to ``response_body_annotations``.
    - Modify HTTP response headers by mutating ``headers``.

    Attributes:
        result: The response data — either a ``dict[str, Any]`` (non-streaming) or an
            ``AsyncIterator[dict[str, Any]]`` (streaming). Passed to the next plugin in
            the chain, or returned to the caller if this is the last plugin. For
            non-streaming responses, mutate this only when ``typed_body`` is ``None``.
            For streaming responses, mutate or replace this when changing the outbound
            client stream.
        headers: HTTP response headers returned to the caller. Mutate to add or modify
            headers (e.g. ``X-Guardrails-Status``). Changes flow through the return value.
        typed_body: SDK-native parsed response data for middleware that wants
            typed access. ``None`` when the backend format is unknown or parsing fails.
            For non-streaming responses, if this is non-``None``, it is canonical.
            For streaming responses, it is a middleware-only view over the raw stream.
            If a plugin needs to return a non-streaming shape that does not fit the
            typed SDK schema, it must set ``response.typed_body = None`` and mutate
            ``response.result`` instead.

            Mirrors ``InferenceRequest.typed_body``: just as ``request.typed_body`` is
            the typed view of ``body``, ``response.typed_body`` is the typed view of
            ``result``.
        response_body_annotations: Top-level fields to be merged into the final
            response body after all middleware have run. Use this — not ``result``
            or ``typed_body`` — when adding fields that do not belong to the
            OpenAI/Anthropic payload schema (e.g. guardrails metadata, custom
            plugin telemetry). For non-streaming responses, IGW merges these into
            the serialized payload just before returning to the caller. For
            streaming responses, annotations are not injected in the initial
            implementation.

            Once an :class:`InferenceResponse` exists, this field is the
            canonical response-annotation owner. IGW may seed it from
            :attr:`InferenceMiddlewareContext.response_body_annotations` when
            building the envelope, but later response middleware can read,
            preserve, modify, or remove annotations here.

            Keys in ``response_body_annotations`` take precedence
            over payload keys on collision. Use plugin-scoped names (e.g.
            ``"guardrails_data"``, not ``"status"``) to avoid cross-plugin collisions.

        Receive ``request`` (body + headers + path), optionally modify it, and return
        the updated :class:`InferenceRequest`.  Mutate ``request.body``,
        ``request.headers``, and/or ``request.path`` in-place and return ``request``,
        or construct and return a new :class:`InferenceRequest`.

        Use ``ctx.state("my-plugin").set(key, value)`` to store data that
        ``process_response`` will need.  ``ctx.original_request`` provides a
        read-only snapshot of the request as it entered this plugin chain.

        Args:
            ctx: Per-request context — routing metadata, original request snapshot,
                and plugin scratch space.  ``ctx.proxied_request`` is ``None`` here
                (it is set by IGW after the request chain finishes).
            request: The current :class:`InferenceRequest`.  When called,
                ``request.body["model"]`` contains the model entity name written by
                IGW from ``VirtualModel.default_model_entity`` (if set).  Middleware
                may rewrite ``request.body["model"]`` to any valid model entity name
                and IGW will resolve and proxy it.  Middleware may also rewrite
                ``request.path`` to change the backend URI.
            middleware_config: The validated, cached config — the value returned
                by :meth:`validate_middleware_config` at VirtualModel cache-build
                time. Never resolved per-request.

        Returns:
            - :class:`InferenceRequest`: The modified request. IGW resolves
              ``request.body["model"]`` to a ``ModelProvider`` and proxies.
            - :class:`ImmediateResponse`: Plugin handled the request itself. IGW
              skips the proxy and passes ``data`` (a :data:`ResponseResult`) to
              the response middleware chain.

        Raises:
            InferenceMiddlewareUnavailableError: A service the plugin depends on
                is unavailable. IGW returns 503 by default.
            InferenceMiddlewareError: Any other handled error with a custom
                ``status_code``.

        Default: return ``request`` unchanged — IGW proxies the request as-is.

        Receive ``response`` (result + headers, and possibly ``typed_result``),
        optionally modify it, and return the updated :class:`InferenceResponse`.

        ``ctx.original_request`` provides the read-only client request (available
        from the request phase). ``ctx.proxied_request`` provides the request that
        was forwarded to the backend (``None`` when an :class:`ImmediateResponse`
        short-circuited the proxy). Use ``ctx.state("my-plugin").get(key)`` to
        retrieve data stored during ``process_request``.

        Canonical response contract: for non-streaming responses, when
        ``response.typed_body`` is not ``None``, mutate or replace
        ``response.typed_body`` and leave ``response.result`` as the raw
        fallback. For streaming responses, ``response.typed_body`` is a
        middleware-only typed view and IGW serializes ``response.result``. When
        ``response.typed_body`` is ``None``, mutate ``response.result``. IGW
        does not synchronize the two views between plugins. If you need to return
        a non-streaming shape that does not fit the typed SDK schema, set
        ``response.typed_body = None`` and mutate ``response.result``.

        Args:
            ctx: Per-request context.  ``ctx.original_request`` is the client
                request (before any plugin ran).  ``ctx.proxied_request`` is what
                IGW forwarded to the backend (``None`` for :class:`ImmediateResponse`
                paths).
            response: The current :class:`InferenceResponse`.  ``response.result``
                is either a ``dict[str, Any]`` (non-streaming) or an
                ``AsyncIterator[dict[str, Any]]`` (streaming). For non-streaming
                responses, a non-``None`` ``response.typed_body`` is the canonical
                parsed SDK-native response object. For streaming responses,
                ``response.typed_body`` is a middleware-only parsed view and
                ``response.result`` is the outbound client stream. Modify
                ``response.headers`` to add or change headers returned to the caller.
            middleware_config: The validated, cached config (same semantics as in
                :meth:`process_request`).

        Returns:
            An :class:`InferenceResponse`, possibly with a modified ``result`` or
            ``headers``. Passed to the next plugin in the response middleware chain,
            or returned to the caller if this is the last plugin.
