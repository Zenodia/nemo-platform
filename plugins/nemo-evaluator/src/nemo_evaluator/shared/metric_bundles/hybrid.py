"""Hybrid metric bundle packager.

Packages each metric with the lightest representation that supports it: built-in
metric types are bundled inline (config-serialized, reconstructed from the metric
type union), and only metrics that cannot be reconstructed from configuration are
cloudpickled. This minimizes cloudpickle usage so built-in metrics avoid the
Python-version coupling of cloudpickle payloads — relevant when a remote service
runs a different interpreter than the submitter.
