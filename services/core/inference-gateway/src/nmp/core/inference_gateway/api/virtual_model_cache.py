"""In-memory cache for VirtualModel entities.

VirtualModels are fetched from the IGW's own VirtualModel API via the platform SDK
(``sdk.inference.virtual_models.list(workspace="-")``), following the same pattern used by
:mod:`model_cache` for ``ModelProvider``\\ s.

The cache is refreshed by :func:`refresh_virtual_model_cache`, which is called from
inside :func:`~nmp.core.inference_gateway.api.model_cache.refresh_model_cache` so both
caches stay in sync on the same background interval with no additional configuration.

      cached value, or
    - It is in :attr:`PrefetchResult.missing` **and** still present in *known_versions*

      definitive deletion via

      referencing VirtualModel must re-resolve (and the registry will mark it broken).
      On subsequent cycles the ref is already absent from *known_versions*, so it is
      **not** re-flagged — the dependent VMs are already broken and re-resolving them
      every poll cycle would only produce redundant warnings.

    Refs in :attr:`PrefetchResult.transient` leave their *known_versions* entry untouched
    and are **not** added to the returned set: this is the "don't flap on transient
    failures" invariant — a brief SDK / network glitch must not invalidate a previously
    healthy resolution.

    Refs no longer present in *current_refs* (no VM references them anymore) are pruned
    from *known_versions* so the map does not grow unboundedly. Refs in
    :attr:`PrefetchResult.missing` are also pruned so a recreated config with a fresh
