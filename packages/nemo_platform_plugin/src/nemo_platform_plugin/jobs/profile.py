"""Profile-stamping helper for ``PlatformJobSpec``.

:func:`stamp_profile` walks ``spec.steps`` and applies ``step.executor.profile``
when the compiler didn't set one explicitly. This implements the phase-1
profile-resolution invariant (see plan-phase-1.md §4b) — per-step overrides
win; otherwise the job-level profile is stamped across every step.

Plugin services call this inside their custom ``compile()`` right before
returning the ``PlatformJobSpec`` to the factory::

    from nemo_platform_plugin.jobs.profile import stamp_profile

    def compile(self, *, profile, ...):
        spec = PlatformJobSpec(steps=[...])
        stamp_profile(spec, profile or "default")
        return spec

The helper mutates *spec* in place and also returns it for chaining.

Why it lives in ``nemo_platform_plugin`` and not in the Jobs service:

Each step's ``executor`` is a discriminated union
(``CPUExecutionProviderParam`` / ``GPUExecutionProviderParam`` /
``DistributedGPUExecutionProviderParam``) from the generated
``nemo_platform`` SDK. All three carry a ``profile: str`` field — that's the
only attribute the stamper touches. Keeping the helper in ``nemo_platform_plugin``
alongside the factory avoids dragging plugin-service code through the Jobs
service's internals and matches where ``add_job_routes()`` already lives.

    """Apply *profile* to every step executor that hasn't set one already.

    Per-step overrides set by the compiler win — this helper only fills in
    the blanks. An "unset" profile is either the attribute missing, the
    attribute set to ``None``, or the attribute set to the empty string.
    Everything else is treated as a deliberate per-step override and left
    alone.

    Args:
        spec: A ``PlatformJobSpec`` (or duck-typed equivalent — anything
            with a ``steps`` attribute, where each step has an ``executor``
            attribute with a ``profile`` attribute).
        profile: The job-level profile name. Typically the submitter's
            ``--profile <p>`` value; callers that want to default explicitly
            should pass ``profile or "default"``.

    Returns:
        The same *spec* object, for call chaining.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If *spec* lacks a ``steps`` attribute or any step's
            ``executor`` lacks ``profile``.
