# Upload Dataset to Files Service (CLI)

You have access to the `nemo` CLI for NeMo Platform operations. Note: MCP tools are not available in this environment - you must use the CLI.

## Task

Complete the following dataset upload operations using the `nemo` CLI:

1. Create a fileset named `harbor-dataset-fileset` with description `Dataset fileset for harbor eval`
2. Create a local training data file `training.jsonl` with at least 3 rows in prompt/completion JSONL format (each line: `{"prompt": "...", "completion": "..."}`)
3. Create a local validation data file `validation.jsonl` with at least 2 rows in the same prompt/completion JSONL format
4. Create a local testing data file `testing.jsonl` with at least 2 rows in the same prompt/completion JSONL format
5. Upload all three JSONL files to the `harbor-dataset-fileset` fileset
6. List the files in the fileset to verify all three uploads succeeded

## Available CLI Commands

The `nemo` CLI is available at `/app/.venv/bin/nemo`. The CLI connects to the local NeMo Platform API server at http://localhost:8080 by default.

- `nemo files filesets create <name> --description "<description>"` - Create a new fileset
- `nemo files upload <local_path> <fileset_name>` - Upload a file to a fileset
- `nemo files list <fileset_name>` - List files in a fileset
- `nemo files filesets list` - List all filesets
- `nemo files filesets get <name>` - Retrieve a fileset by name

## JSONL Format

Each line in the JSONL files should be a valid JSON object with `prompt` and `completion` fields. For example:

```
{"prompt": "What is the capital of France?", "completion": "The capital of France is Paris."}
```

Use realistic but simple question-answer pairs. The content can be anything as long as the format is correct.

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
- A fileset named `harbor-dataset-fileset` exists with description `Dataset fileset for harbor eval`
- Three JSONL files (`training.jsonl`, `validation.jsonl`, `testing.jsonl`) have been uploaded to the fileset
- Each file contains valid JSONL data with `prompt` and `completion` fields on every line
- `training.jsonl` has at least 3 rows, `validation.jsonl` has at least 2 rows, `testing.jsonl` has at least 2 rows
