"""Plugin job interface — what plugin authors implement for schedulable jobs.

Plugin authors subclass :class:`NemoJob` and register the class under the
``nemo.jobs`` entry-point group. The platform (or SDK) instantiates each class
and invokes it through the :class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.scheduler.NemoJobScheduler`
for local execution, or POSTs it to the plugin service for remote submission.

Mental model — *Job = spec + profile + options*:

- **``spec``** — what the job should do (plugin-authored schema). The canonical
  shape ``run()`` and ``compile()`` see is :attr:`spec_schema`.
- **``profile``** — where to run it, operator-configured; a submitter picks it
  via ``--profile``.
- **``options``** — how to tune it for the resolved backend, as an opaque
  ``{"<backend>": {...}}`` bag forwarded to the Jobs service.

One class, mixed-colour methods. Each method's colour is fixed by where
it executes — plugin authors never make a class-level sync/async choice:

- :meth:`NemoJob.to_spec` and :meth:`NemoJob.compile` are
  ``async classmethod``s. They run in the API process, where async I/O
  is the right default.
- :meth:`NemoJob.run` and :meth:`NemoJob.report_progress` are sync
  ``def``. They run in the task container, where there is no event loop
  and most work calls into sync library protocols.

The scheduler runs the async lifecycle methods through a single
``asyncio.run`` at the top of :meth:`NemoJobScheduler.run_local`; the
sync ``run`` is invoked directly from the resulting canonical spec.

Example::

    # my_plugin/jobs/train.py
    from nemo_platform_plugin.job import NemoJob
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class TrainSpec(BaseModel):
        model: str
        epochs: int = 1

    class TrainJob(NemoJob):
        name        = "train"
        description = "Fine-tune a model"
        container   = "gpu-tasks"
        spec_schema = TrainSpec

        def run(self, config: dict) -> dict:
            # config is the spec as a dict, validated server-side against spec_schema
            spec = TrainSpec.model_validate(config)
            ...
            return {"status": "completed", "model": spec.model}

    # pyproject.toml:
    # [project.entry-points."nemo.jobs"]
    # my-plugin.train = "my_plugin.jobs.train:TrainJob"

Entry-point key convention: ``<plugin-name>.<job-name>``, e.g.
``example.say-hello``. This lets
:func:`~nemo_platform_plugin.discovery.discover_jobs` resolve jobs unambiguously
across plugins; programmatic execution goes through
:meth:`nemo_platform_plugin.scheduler.NemoJobScheduler.run_local`.

class NemoJob(_NamedPlugin):
    """Abstract base class for plugin-contributed schedulable jobs.

    Subclasses declare their identity via class variables and implement
    :meth:`run`. The platform instantiates each class and invokes its
    lifecycle — plugin authors never manage submission themselves.

    Identity and container:

    .. attribute:: name
        :type: str

        Unique job name within the plugin (e.g. ``"train"``). Combined with
        the plugin name for the full entry-point key (``"my-plugin.train"``).

    .. attribute:: description
        :type: str

        Human-readable description shown in ``nemo plugins list`` and CLI
        help.

    .. attribute:: container
        :type: str

        Container image key for remote execution (e.g. ``"gpu-tasks"``,
        ``"cpu-tasks"``). Used by the Jobs service to pick the right
        container image for each step. Ignored for local execution.

    .. attribute:: execution_provider
        :type: str

        Default compute-workload *shape* for single-step execution. One of
        ``"cpu"``, ``"gpu"``, ``"gpu_distributed"``. Multi-step jobs that
        override :meth:`compile` decide providers per step and can ignore
        this default.

    Spec schemas:

    .. attribute:: spec_schema
        :type: type[pydantic.BaseModel] | None

        Canonical Pydantic model for the job's inputs. ``run()`` and
        ``compile()`` always see a ``spec_schema`` instance. Declaring
        this lets the scheduler validate incoming specs before
        invocation and lets ``nemo <plugin> <job> explain`` surface the
        schema over OpenAPI. ``None`` means the raw dict flows through
        unchanged — prefer a concrete model for new jobs.

    .. attribute:: input_spec_schema
        :type: type[pydantic.BaseModel] | None

        Optional submitter-facing shape when the input differs from the
        canonical spec (e.g. a user-typed dataset name that resolves to a
        URL). When present, the scheduler / plugin service parses the
        incoming spec against this schema, then calls :meth:`to_spec` to
        produce a ``spec_schema`` instance before ``run()`` / ``compile()``
        see it. When ``None``, ``spec_schema`` is used on both sides and
        :meth:`to_spec` is an identity function.

    API routes:

    .. attribute:: job_collection_path
        :type: str | None

        Optional override for the job collection path relative to
        ``/apis/{api}/v2/workspaces/{workspace}``. When omitted, the
        default is ``/jobs/{name}``. Both the plugin service route helper
        and generated CLI submission use this value, so the API route and
        CLI command stay in sync. Examples: ``None`` for ``/jobs/train``
        when ``name = "train"``; ``"/metric-jobs"`` for a legacy flat
        collection path.

    Plugin-owned options:

    .. attribute:: backend_options_schemas
        :type: dict[str, type[pydantic.BaseModel]]

        Per-backend Pydantic schemas for plugin-authored tuning knobs
        that live inside ``options.<backend>``. Currently inert —
        declared here as a stable surface so plugins can land their
        schemas before validation and OpenAPI surfacing come online.
