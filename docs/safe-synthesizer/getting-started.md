# Getting Started with {{nss_short_name}}

Get started with {{nss_short_name}} for generating private synthetic versions of sensitive tabular datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before using {{nss_short_name}}, complete the [{{platform_name}} Quickstart](../get-started/quickstart.md) to install the CLI/SDK and deploy the platform.

{{nss_short_name}} has the following additional requirements:

- An NVIDIA GPU **on the host machine** with 80GB+ VRAM (check with `nvidia-smi`). This is separate from any GPU inside a NIM container — Safe Synthesizer training runs directly on the host.
- Sufficient disk space for generated datasets (50GB+ recommended)

For general platform troubleshooting (port conflicts, health checks, and so on), refer to the [main quickstart guide](../get-started/quickstart.md).

## Host-local CLI

For GPU development on your machine, install the Safe Synthesizer plugin from this repository and use `nemo safe-synthesizer run-local` (see [Host-Local Development and Testing](about/host-local-development.md)):

```shell
BOOTSTRAP_LOCAL_PLUGIN_DIRS=plugins/nemo-safe-synthesizer make bootstrap-python
uv run nemo safe-synthesizer runtime setup
uv run nemo safe-synthesizer run-local \
  --spec-file ./nss-job.json \
  --data-source ./input.csv \
  --output-dir ./nss-output
```

Platform job submission (Jobs API, Studio, tutorials) is documented separately in [Jobs](about/jobs.md) and the [tutorials](tutorials/index.md). The `nemo safe-synthesizer` CLI today exposes **run-local** and **runtime** only.

## Next Steps

Run one of the [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) to create your first synthetic dataset:

- [Safe Synthesizer 101 Tutorial](tutorials/safe-synthesizer-101.md) - A beginner-friendly introduction
- [Differential Privacy Tutorial](tutorials/differential-privacy.md) - Generate differentially-private synthetic data
