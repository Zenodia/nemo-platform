"""Convention-based loader that yields a FastAPI app for any nemo plugin.

Plugins register their service class under the ``nemo.services`` entry-point
group. ``discover_services()`` enumerates that group; we instantiate the class
(no constructor args by contract — per-request deps inject at runtime via
FastAPI), wrap it in ``NemoServiceAdapter`` to obtain the per-service FastAPI
app, and mount that app's router under ``/apis/<plugin-name>`` on a parent
FastAPI so the generated OpenAPI paths match production routing (the platform
runner mounts plugins at the same prefix at startup — see
``nmp.platform_runner.server`` ``include_router(prefix=f"/apis/{service_instance.name}")``).

A plugin that needs special construction (e.g. constructor args, env-var
preconditions) sets ``factory_override`` on its ``PluginConfig`` instead of
relying on this loader.
