"""Script to seed the Intake service with diverse, realistic entry records.

Posts to the v2 Intake API. Creates three types of diverse tasks:
1. Conversational Support - Progressive 10-turn conversation with user feedback events
2. Tool Calling Examples - Single-turn tool calling scenarios with occasional user feedback
3. Query Rewriting - Complex question rewriting with user feedback and reviewer corrections

Examples:
    # Seed the local quickstart
    python -m scripts.seed-entries

    # Seed a deployed environment
    python -m scripts.seed-entries --api-url https://nemo.example.com

    # Seed a non-default workspace
    python -m scripts.seed-entries --workspace my-team

    # Delete all existing entries in the target workspace before seeding
    python -m scripts.seed-entries --workspace my-team --clear

When i becomes 3 or 4, you're trying to access `numbers[3]` and `numbers[4]` which don't exist.\n\nHere's the fix:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nfor i in range(len(numbers)):  # This ensures i only goes from 0 to 2\n    print(numbers[i])\n```\n\nOr even better, use direct iteration:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```",

It\'s the Pythonic way to get both:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nfor i, number in enumerate(numbers):\n    print(f"Index {i}: {number}")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nIndex 0: 1\nIndex 1: 2\nIndex 2: 3\n```\n\nThe `enumerate()` function returns tuples of (index, value) for each item in your list, so you avoid the index out of range error while still having access to both pieces of information.',

Here are a few approaches:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty first:**\n```python\nnumbers = []\nif numbers:  # This is False for empty lists\n    for i, number in enumerate(numbers):\n        print(f"Index {i}: {number}")\nelse:\n    print("List is empty!")\n```\n\n2. **Use try-except for specific operations:**\n```python\nnumbers = []\ntry:\n    first_item = numbers[0]\n    print(f"First item: {first_item}")\nexcept IndexError:\n    print("No items in the list")\n```\n\n3. **Use get-like methods for safe access:**\n```python\nnumbers = []\n# Safe way to get first item with default\nfirst_item = numbers[0] if numbers else "No items"\nprint(first_item)\n```\n\nThe `enumerate()` and direct iteration approaches handle empty lists gracefully - they simply don\'t execute the loop body.',

                "assistant": "Absolutely! Here are some best practices to avoid index errors and write more robust Python code:\n\n**1. Prefer iteration over indexing:**\n```python\n# Good\nfor item in my_list:\n    process(item)\n\n# Less preferred\nfor i in range(len(my_list)):\n    process(my_list[i])\n```\n\n**2. Use built-in functions:**\n- `enumerate()` when you need indices\n- `zip()` for parallel iteration\n- `len()` to check bounds\n\n**3. Validate inputs:**\n```python\ndef get_item(lst, index):\n    if 0 <= index < len(lst):\n        return lst[index]\n    return None  # or raise a custom exception\n```\n\n**4. Use list comprehensions and built-ins:**\n```python\n# Instead of manual loops that might have index errors\nresults = [process(item) for item in my_list if condition(item)]\n```\n\n**5. Consider using `get()` method for dictionaries and similar patterns for lists.**\n\nThe key is to write code that's naturally safe by design rather than trying to catch errors after the fact!",

                "assistant": "You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help you understand list indexing better. Debugging can be frustrating, but you handled it really well by providing the code example - that made all the difference in identifying the issue quickly.\n\nFeel free to come back anytime you have more Python questions. Happy coding, and remember: when in doubt, `print()` statements and the Python debugger are your friends for tracking down tricky issues!",

                "user": "Actually, one quick follow-up. What's this Python debugger you mentioned?",
                "assistant": 'Great question! Python has a built-in debugger called `pdb` (Python Debugger) that\'s incredibly useful for stepping through code and inspecting variables.\n\n**Basic usage:**\n```python\nimport pdb\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\npdb.set_trace()  # Execution will pause here\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(numbers[i])  # You can inspect this line-by-line\n```\n\n**Key pdb commands:**\n- `n` (next): Execute next line\n- `s` (step): Step into function calls\n- `c` (continue): Continue execution\n- `l` (list): Show current code\n- `p variable_name`: Print variable value\n- `pp variable_name`: Pretty-print variable\n- `q` (quit): Exit debugger\n\n**Modern alternatives:**\n- `breakpoint()` (Python 3.7+) - cleaner than `pdb.set_trace()`\n- IDE debuggers (PyCharm, VS Code) - visual debugging\n- `ipdb` - enhanced debugger with IPython features\n\n**Quick example:**\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nfor i in range(5):\n    breakpoint()  # Pause here each iteration\n    print(f"About to access index {i}")\n    print(numbers[i])\n```\n\nThis would let you see exactly when `i` becomes problematic!',

                "assistant": "Great question! Getting \"stuck\" in the debugger is a common experience when you're first learning it. Here's how to get out:\n\n**To exit the debugger:**\n1. Type `q` and press Enter - this quits the debugger\n2. If that doesn't work, try `Ctrl+C` (sometimes needed if the debugger is unresponsive)\n3. As a last resort, `Ctrl+Z` (on Unix/Mac) or `Ctrl+Break` (Windows) to force quit\n\n**Pro tips to avoid getting stuck:**\n```python\n# Remove debugger statements when done debugging\n# breakpoint()  # Comment out or delete\n\n# Or use conditional breakpoints\nif some_condition:\n    breakpoint()\n\n# Environment variable to disable all breakpoints\n# Set PYTHONBREAKPOINT=0 to disable all breakpoint() calls\n```\n\n**If you're in an interactive session:**\n- The debugger will show `(Pdb)` prompt\n- Type `c` to continue execution\n- Type `q` to quit back to normal Python prompt\n\n**In IDEs:**\n- Usually there's a \"Stop\" or \"Terminate\" button\n- Or use the IDE's keyboard shortcut (often Shift+F5)\n\n**Remember:** The debugger is pausing execution, not breaking anything. Your program will resume normally once you continue or quit. Don't panic if you accidentally trigger it - just type `q` and you're back to normal!",

That's exactly the kind of learning journey that will make you a stronger developer.\n\nRemember these key takeaways:\n- Use `enumerate()` and direct iteration when possible\n- Validate inputs and handle edge cases\n- The debugger (`breakpoint()`) is your friend for complex issues\n- Don't be afraid to add `print()` statements for quick debugging\n\nYou've got this!

Here are some excellent debugging tools beyond `pdb`:\n\n**Enhanced Debuggers:**\n- **ipdb** - Like pdb but with IPython features (syntax highlighting, tab entry)\n- **pudb** - Full-screen console debugger with a nice UI\n- **web-pdb** - Debug in your browser instead of terminal\n\n**IDE Integration:**\n- **PyCharm** - Excellent visual debugger with breakpoints, variable inspection\n- **VS Code** - Great Python debugging with the Python extension\n- **Thonny** - Beginner-friendly IDE with step-through debugging\n\n**Profiling & Performance:**\n- **cProfile** - Built-in performance profiler\n- **line_profiler** - Line-by-line performance analysis\n- **memory_profiler** - Track memory usage\n\n**Logging & Monitoring:**\n- **loguru** - Much better than standard logging\n- **rich** - Beautiful console output and tracebacks\n- **icecream** - Better than print() for debugging\n\n**Quick example with icecream:**\n```python\nfrom icecream import ic\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nfor i in range(5):\n    ic(i, len(numbers))  # Shows: i=3, len(numbers)=3\n    if i < len(numbers):\n        ic(numbers[i])\n```\n\nStart with your IDE's debugger for visual debugging, and icecream for quick print-style debugging.

                "assistant": "Ah, that's likely the issue! Running validation on every keystroke is expensive. Here are some optimizations:\n\n**1.

Use React Hook Form (recommended):**\n```jsx\nimport { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';\n\nfunction OptimizedForm() {\n  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm();\n  \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n      <input {...register('email', { required: true })} />\n      {errors.email && <span>Email is required</span>}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nReact Hook Form minimizes re-renders by using uncontrolled components under the hood.

Image optimization:**\n```jsx\n// Use next/image or similar\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src={src} alt={alt} />\n```\n\n**5. Avoid inline objects/functions:**\n```jsx\n// Bad - creates new object on every render\n<Component style={{margin: 10}} />\n\n// Good - stable reference\nconst styles = {margin: 10};\n<Component style={styles} />\n```\n\nStart with memoization - it'll give you the biggest wins! 🚀",

Optimize dependencies:**\n```jsx\n// Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives\n// moment.js (67KB) → date-fns (13KB)\n// lodash (69KB) → native JS methods when possible\n// entire icon library → specific icons only\n```\n\n**6. Preloading critical resources:**\n```html\n<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/main.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>\n<link rel="preload" href="/critical.css" as="style">\n```\n\nStart with bundle analysis to see what\'s actually taking up space - you might be surprised! 📊',
            },
            {
                "user": "Bundle analysis revealed that Chart.js is taking up 40% of my bundle! But I only use it on one admin page. How can I optimize this?",
                "assistant": "Perfect example of where code splitting shines! Chart.js is a beast (300KB+), but you can easily load it only when needed:\n\n**1. Route-level splitting (easiest):**\n```jsx\n// AdminDashboard.jsx - split the entire page\nconst AdminDashboard = lazy(() => import('./pages/AdminDashboard'));\n\n<Route path=\"/admin\" element={\n  <Suspense fallback={<AdminLoading />}>\n    <AdminDashboard />\n  </Suspense>\n} />\n```\n\n**2. Component-level splitting (more granular):**\n```jsx\n// ChartComponent.jsx - split just the chart\nconst ChartComponent = lazy(() => import('./components/ChartComponent'));\n\nfunction AdminPage() {\n  const [showChart, setShowChart] = useState(false);\n  \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setShowChart(true)}>Show Analytics</button>\n      {showChart && (\n        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading chart...</div>}>\n          <ChartComponent data={chartData} />\n        </Suspense>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**3. Dynamic import with loading state:**\n```jsx\nfunction AdminPage() {\n  const [Chart, setChart] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n  \n  const loadChart = async () => {\n    setLoading(true);\n    try {\n      const chartModule = await import('chart.js/auto');\n      setChart(() => chartModule.default);\n    } finally {\n      setLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n  \n  return (\n    <div>\n      {!Chart && (\n        <button onClick={loadChart} disabled={loading}>\n          {loading ? 'Loading...' : 'Show Analytics'}\n        </button>\n      )}\n      {Chart && <MyChart Chart={Chart} />}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**4. Consider lighter alternatives:**\n```jsx\n// Chart.js is feature-rich but heavy\n// Recharts (smaller, React-specific)\nimport { LineChart, Line } from 'recharts';\n\n// Or even lighter solutions\nimport { Sparklines, SparklinesLine } from 'react-sparklines';\n```\n\n**Pro tip:** After splitting Chart.js out, your main bundle should be 40% smaller, and your admin page will load Chart.js in parallel while users navigate to it. Win-win! 🎯\n\nWhat does your bundle analysis show as the next biggest culprit?",
            },
            {
                "user": "Amazing! After implementing route splitting, my initial load went from 8 seconds to 2 seconds. The next biggest issue seems to be images - they're really slowing things down.",
                "assistant": 'Fantastic progress! 🚀 Images are often the silent performance killer. Here\'s how to optimize them:\n\n**1. Image format optimization:**\n```jsx\n// Modern formats with fallbacks\n<picture>\n  <source srcSet="image.avif" type="image/avif" />\n  <source srcSet="image.webp" type="image/webp" />\n  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />\n</picture>\n\n// Or use Next.js Image component (handles this automatically)\nimport Image from \'next/image\';\n<Image src="/image.jpg" width={400} height={300} alt="Description" />\n```\n\n**2. Lazy loading (huge impact):**\n```jsx\n// Native lazy loading\n<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description" />\n\n// Or React library\nimport { LazyLoadImage } from \'react-lazy-load-image-component\';\n<LazyLoadImage src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />\n```\n\n**3. Responsive images:**\n```jsx\n// Serve different sizes based on viewport\n<img\n  srcSet="\n    image-small.jpg 400w,\n    image-medium.jpg 800w,\n    image-large.jpg 1200w\n  "\n  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1000px) 800px, 1200px"\n  src="image-medium.jpg"\n  alt="Description"\n/>\n```\n\n**4. Image compression & tools:**\n```bash\n# Squoosh (Google) - online tool\n# ImageOptim - Mac app\n# TinyPNG - online compression\n\n# Or automate with webpack\nnpm install --save-dev imagemin-webpack-plugin\n```\n\n**5. Critical images vs non-critical:**\n```jsx\n// Preload critical above-the-fold images\n<link rel="preload" as="image" href="hero-image.jpg" />\n\n// Lazy load everything else\n<img src="below-fold.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description" />\n```\n\n**6. Progressive loading:**\n```jsx\n// Show low-quality placeholder first\nconst [imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = useState(false);\n\n<div style={{ backgroundImage: imageLoaded ? \'none\' : \'url(tiny-blur.jpg)\' }}>\n  <img \n    src="full-quality.jpg" \n    onLoad={() => setImageLoaded(true)}\n    style={{ opacity: imageLoaded ? 1 : 0 }}\n  />\n</div>\n```\n\n**Quick wins to try first:**\n1. Add `loading="lazy"` to all below-the-fold images\n2. Convert large images to WebP format\n3. Compress images (aim for <100KB per image)\n4. Use responsive images for different screen sizes\n\nYou should see another significant improvement! What\'s your current image strategy? 📸',

                "assistant": 'That\'s an amazing improvement! 🎉 From 45 to 92 is fantastic. Here\'s how to keep it that way as you scale:\n\n**1. Performance monitoring:**\n```jsx\n// Core Web Vitals tracking\nimport { getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB } from \'web-vitals\';\n\nfunction sendToAnalytics(metric) {\n  // Send to your analytics service\n  console.log(metric);\n}\n\ngetCLS(sendToAnalytics);\ngetFID(sendToAnalytics);\ngetFCP(sendToAnalytics);\ngetLCP(sendToAnalytics);\ngetTTFB(sendToAnalytics);\n```\n\n**2. Performance budgets & CI:**\n```json\n// In package.json - fail builds if bundle gets too big\n"scripts": {\n  "build": "react-scripts build && npm run check-size",\n  "check-size": "bundlesize"\n},\n"bundlesize": [\n  {\n    "path": "./build/static/js/*.js",\n    "maxSize": "300kb"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n**3. Regular audits:**\n```bash\n# Automate Lighthouse in CI\nnpm install -g @lhci/cli\nlhci autorun\n\n# Bundle analysis on every PR\nnpm run build && npm run analyze\n```\n\n**4. Performance-first development habits:**\n```jsx\n// Always consider performance impact\n// ❌ Adding heavy library for one function\nimport _ from \'lodash\'; // 69KB for one function\n\n// ✅ Write the function yourself or use smaller alternative\nconst debounce = (fn, delay) => { /* implementation */ };\n\n// ❌ Large state objects\nconst [appState, setAppState] = useState(massiveObject);\n\n// ✅ Split state logically\nconst [user, setUser] = useState();\nconst [settings, setSettings] = useState();\n```\n\n**5. Team guidelines:**\n```markdown\n## Performance Checklist\n- [ ] New images are compressed and lazy-loaded\n- [ ] New dependencies are justified (check bundle impact)\n- [ ] New routes are code-split\n- [ ] Heavy computations are memoized\n- [ ] Lighthouse score stays above 90\n```\n\n**6. Automated performance testing:**\n```javascript\n// In your test suite\ntest(\'Homepage loads in under 2 seconds\', async () => {\n  const start = Date.now();\n  await render(<HomePage />);\n  expect(Date.now() - start).toBeLessThan(2000);\n});\n```\n\n**Pro tips for sustainable performance:**\n- Make Lighthouse audits part of your PR process\n- Set up bundle size alerts\n- Regular "performance debt" cleanup sessions\n- Celebrate performance wins with the team! 🎯\n\nYou\'ve built something awesome - keep it fast! What\'s your next performance challenge going to be?',
