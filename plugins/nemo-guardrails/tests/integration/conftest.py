"""Pytest fixtures for the guardrails plugin integration tests.

Re-exports the IGW harness fixtures so test modules don't have to
import them. ``_igw_extra_services`` is overridden below to mount
:class:`GuardrailsService` on the module-scoped app — entity-backed
guardrail-config tests need its CRUD routes. The module-scope helpers
(``_igw_app_context``, ``_igw_loopback_context``) are re-imported so
pytest can resolve the dependency chain from this conftest's scope.

``HF_HUB_OFFLINE`` is set at conftest import time, **before** the
``GuardrailsService`` import below — importing ``GuardrailsService``
transitively imports ``nemoguardrails``, which reaches HuggingFace at
import time if not told to stay offline. A function-scoped autouse
``monkeypatch`` fixture would be too late: it doesn't run until after
the module-scoped fixture setup that triggers these imports.
