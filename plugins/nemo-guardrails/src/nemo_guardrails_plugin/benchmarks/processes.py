"""Process supervision for the benchmark harness.

The harness fans out several long-lived child processes per run (two mock LLM
``uvicorn`` servers, ``nemo services run``, and the AIPerf shim) and must clean
them all up — including any workers they fork — even when the parent dies
mid-run. This module wraps ``subprocess.Popen`` in a context-managed
``SupervisedProcess`` that:

* runs each child in a new session (``start_new_session=True``) so we can send
  signals to the whole process group via ``os.killpg`` and reap workers that
  ``uvicorn --workers N`` and ``nemo services`` fork off,
* merges stdout/stderr into a per-process log file under ``run_dir/logs/``,
* escalates SIGTERM → SIGKILL on shutdown if the child doesn't exit in time.

``supervised_processes`` starts the children in order, polls each spec's
``health_url`` before moving on, and guarantees every already-started child is
stopped if a later one fails to come up. ``wait_http`` implements the readiness
probe used by ``supervised_processes`` and for externally managed dependencies
(ex. ``--reuse-services``).
