    Data Designer's interface runtime configures logging by clearing root
    handlers. Inside the platform API process that removes NeMo Platform's structured
    logging handler and its internal-request filter, so background controller
    traffic starts printing as ordinary request logs and we start seeing flood of
    logs like "Request Completed", which are the requests that jobs and Models
    Controllers send in some interval. This helper keeps the upstream package
    free to initialize its own named loggers, but put the root logger back.
