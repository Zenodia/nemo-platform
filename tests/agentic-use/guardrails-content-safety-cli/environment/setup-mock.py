"""Set up mock inference provider for the content safety eval.

This script runs after the NeMo Platform API server is healthy but before the agent starts.
It configures a mock inference provider that always returns "Yes" to any prompt,
which makes it suitable for use with guardrails self-check rails (blocking all content).

The agent is responsible for creating the guardrail configuration itself.
