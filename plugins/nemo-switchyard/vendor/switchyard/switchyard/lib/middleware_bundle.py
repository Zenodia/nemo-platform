"""Return value of :meth:`MiddlewareFactory.build`.

A :class:`MiddlewareBundle` carries everything a factory contributes to a
host's chain: the request pipeline, the response pipeline, and
**optionally** an :class:`LLMBackend` and a :class:`ResponseTranslator`.
Hosts that own their own backend (NeMo Platform IGW today) ignore the optional
slots and slot the request/response pipelines around their own backend.
Standalone callers (the Switchyard CLI, tests, internal recipes) can
ask the factory for a full chain by populating all four slots and then
call :meth:`MiddlewareBundle.to_switchyard` to get a runnable
:class:`Switchyard`.

Why a dataclass and not a 4-tuple:

* Named slots make it obvious which factories ship a backend and which
  don't — important now that we may have format-translating factories
  (SWITCH-167) that own their own backend selection.
* Optional fields give factories room to grow without breaking the
  protocol (e.g. a factory that contributes both pipelines and a
  pre-validated translator is just three populated fields, not a
  signature change).
* Lets us add helpers — ``to_switchyard`` here, lifecycle wiring
  later — on a single type instead of free functions taking a tuple.
