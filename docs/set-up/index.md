## {{helm_chart_short_name}}

The [{{helm_chart_short_name}}](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo-microservices/helm-charts/nemo-platform) is an all-in-one Helm chart that bundles the complete {{platform_name}} ecosystem and all required dependencies for full platform deployment.

You can also customize the configuration of your installation by updating the `values.yaml` file. You can also use the pre-configured tags to install only specific microservices that you need.

For the chart assets and additional details, refer to the [{{platform_name}} Collection](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo-microservices/collections/nemo-microservices) page in the NVIDIA NGC Catalog.
