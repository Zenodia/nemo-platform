Parallelism Helper Library - Production-ready LLM training parallelization estimator.

This library provides accurate memory estimates and parallelization recommendations for:
- Tensor Parallelism (TP): Shards layers across GPUs
- Pipeline Parallelism (PP): Splits layers across stages
- Data Parallelism (DP): Replicates model, shards data (FSDP/ZeRO)
- Context Parallelism (CP): Shards sequence for long contexts (>8K tokens)
- Expert Parallelism (EP): Shards experts in MoE models

Supported Architectures:
- Standard Transformers (GPT, LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, Phi)
- Mixture of Experts (Mixtral, DeepSeek-MoE, GPT-OSS)
- State-Space Models (Mamba, Hybrid Mamba-Transformer)
- Grouped Query Attention (GQA/MQA)
- Sliding Window Attention (Mistral, Gemma)

Memory Model:
- BF16 mixed precision: 14 bytes/param (2 BF16 + 4 FP32 grad + 8 FP32 optimizer)
- Distributed optimizer (FSDP2): Optimizer states sharded across DP
- Activation checkpointing: Configurable via act_ckpt_ratio
- KV cache: Reduced for Mamba layers and sliding window attention

Validation:
- Tested against NVIDIA NeMo H100 configurations
- Parameter counting: 0.0-0.8% error across 14+ model families
- Communication heuristic tuned to match NeMo preferences

Usage:
    >>> from parallelism_helper import estimate_parallelization
    >>> result = estimate_parallelization("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B", 8, 80, 8192)
    >>> print(f"Best: TP={result.configs[0].tp} DP={result.configs[0].dp}")

    """
    Penalize configurations that leave little room for activations.

    Reasoning:
        Static memory (parameters + gradients + optimizer states) should not consume
        too much GPU memory, as we need headroom for:
        - Activation memory (scales with batch size and sequence length)
        - KV cache (for inference/generation)
        - Temporary buffers (gradient accumulation, communication)

        When static memory exceeds the threshold (default 60%) of GPU memory, the
        configuration becomes memory-constrained and:
        - Limits achievable batch size (hurts throughput)
        - Risks OOM with longer sequences or larger batches
        - Leaves little room for framework overhead

        We use a quadratic penalty to strongly discourage tight memory configs
        and naturally push the heuristic toward higher TP/PP (which reduces
        per-rank static memory through sharding).

    Compute cost for Tensor Parallelism (TP).

    Reasoning:
        TP shards individual layers across GPUs, requiring all-reduce communication
        after every forward/backward pass through each layer. This has both benefits
        and costs:

        Benefits:
        - Reduces per-GPU memory by sharding parameters across TP ranks
        - Essential for very large models that don't fit on single GPU
        - Synchronous communication (no pipeline bubbles like PP)

        Costs:
        - Frequent all-reduce operations (2 per layer per step)
        - Communication scales with: n_layers * d_model * TP degree
        - Bandwidth-intensive for large hidden dimensions

        Model size scaling:
        - Small models (<70B): TP is expensive overhead, prefer DP
        - Medium models (70-300B): TP=4 is reasonable, TP=8 has moderate cost
        - Very large models (>300B): TP=8 is necessary, lower per-unit cost

        Empirical observations from NeMo configs:

    """
    Compute bonus for Data Parallelism (DP). Note: negative cost = bonus!

    Reasoning:
        DP is the most efficient parallelism strategy for throughput because:
        - Gradient all-reduce happens once per optimizer step (infrequent)
        - Each rank processes different data (embarrassingly parallel)
        - No pipeline bubbles or synchronization overhead
        - Linear scaling in throughput with DP degree (ideal)

        However, DP bonus should be tempered by:

        1. Total parallelism: When TP*PP*CP*EP is already high, adding more DP
           has diminishing returns because:
           - The model is already heavily sharded (memory-constrained)
           - Communication overhead from other dimensions dominates
           - Focus should be on fitting the model, not maximizing DP

        2. MoE models: For Mixture of Experts, Expert Parallelism (EP) is more
           important than DP because:
           - EP provides memory efficiency by sharding experts
           - Large MoE models (>40B) need EP to fit in memory
           - EP enables scaling expert count without memory blowup

        3. Model size: Very large models require high TP/PP/EP for memory,
           leaving less room for DP scaling.

        Empirical tuning based on NeMo configs:
        - Small models (TP=1, PP=1): Strong DP preference

    """
    Compute cost for Pipeline Parallelism (PP).

    Reasoning:
        PP divides the model into stages across GPUs, creating a pipeline where
        different micro-batches are processed at different stages simultaneously.

        Benefits:
        - Enables training models that don't fit on single GPU
        - Reduces per-GPU memory by distributing layers across stages
        - Can achieve good throughput with many micro-batches

        Costs:
        - Pipeline bubbles: idle time at start/end of each batch
          * Bubble overhead = (PP - 1) / num_microbatches
          * Requires large global batch size to amortize bubbles
        - Forward/backward dependencies limit parallelism
        - Point-to-point communication between stages

        Model size considerations:
        - Small models (<100B): PP has high bubble overhead, prefer pure DP
        - Medium models (100-300B): PP becomes acceptable if TP alone insufficient
        - Very large models (>300B): PP is often necessary for memory

        Interaction with TP:
        - When TP>1: Model already sharded, PP becomes relatively cheaper
        - When TP=1: Prefer scaling DP for throughput before adding PP

        MoE models:
        - PP is useful for distributing expert-heavy layers across stages
        - Lower bubble impact because expert layers have more compute
        - Enables scaling expert count across pipeline stages

        Memory pressure considerations:
        - When static memory is high (>50% GPU), PP becomes more attractive

    Compute cost for Context Parallelism (CP).

    Reasoning:
        CP shards the sequence dimension across GPUs, reducing per-GPU memory for
        activations and KV cache. This is beneficial when sequence-related memory
        dominates parameter memory.

        Memory breakdown per token (mixed precision):
        - Activations: ~34 * d_model * n_layers bytes/token
        - KV cache: ~4 * d_model * n_layers bytes/token
        - Total: ~38 * d_model * n_layers bytes/token

        Parameter memory (with distributed optimizer):
        - Model weights: 2 bytes/param (BF16)
        - Gradients: 4 bytes/param (FP32)
        - Optimizer states: 8 bytes/param (FP32 Adam)
        - Total: ~14 bytes/param
        - Approximate params: n_layers * 12 * d_model^2

        When to use CP:
        - seq_to_param_ratio > 1.0: Sequence memory dominates, CP highly beneficial
          * Common with long contexts (32K+) on smaller models (7-13B)
          * Optimal CP scales with ratio (more memory pressure = higher CP)

        - seq_to_param_ratio 0.3-1.0: Moderate sequence memory, CP=2 is good
          * Typical with 8-16K contexts on medium models (70B)

    Compute cost for Expert Parallelism (EP) in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models.

    Reasoning:

        This creates unique memory challenges:

        Without EP (EP=1):
        - All ROUTED experts replicated on every GPU
        - Memory scales with: (num_routed_experts * expert_size)
        - Becomes infeasible for models with many large experts
        - Example: 8x7B experts = 56B params per GPU!

        With EP:
        - Routed experts SHARDED across EP ranks
        - Each GPU holds: num_routed_experts / EP experts
        - Memory per GPU reduced by factor of EP
        - Example: 8 experts / EP=8 = 1 expert per GPU

        Note on shared vs routed experts:
        - Routed experts: Sharded by EP (counted in num_experts)
        - Shared experts: Replicated on all ranks (NOT sharded by EP)
        - EP only affects routed expert memory

        Optimal EP strategies:

    Compute bonus for balanced TP/PP combinations.

    Reasoning:
        When using both TP and PP, the balance between them affects efficiency:

        Why balance matters:
        - TP and PP both shard the model, reducing per-GPU memory
        - Balanced TP/PP (e.g., TP=4 PP=4) often better than unbalanced (TP=8 PP=2)
        - Reasons for balance preference:
          1. More uniform memory distribution across GPUs
          2. Better overlap of TP communication with PP computation
          3. Reduced pipeline bubble ratio with more stages
          4. Empirically validated by NeMo configs

        Model size scaling:
        - Small models (<100B): Moderate balance preference
          * Example: TP=2 PP=2 > TP=4 PP=1

        - Large models (100-300B): Strong balance preference
          * Example: TP=4 PP=4 > TP=8 PP=2

        - Very large dense models (>300B): Very strong balance preference
          * Example: TP=8 PP=8 > TP=16 PP=4
          * Perfect balance (TP=PP) is highly optimal

        MoE considerations (EP saturation based on GPU topology):
        - Few experts (<= GPUs per node): Must max EP (EP == num_experts)
          * Example: Mixtral (8 experts) needs EP=8, not EP=4
          * Standard node has 8 GPUs, so 8 experts needs EP=8

        - Many experts (> GPUs per node): EP at node-level is saturated
          * EP >= gpus_per_node (typically 8) is sufficient
          * Example: DeepSeek V3 (256 experts) with EP=8 is saturated

        When EP is saturated:
        - Low/no PP (PP <= 2): No balance bonus (prefer max TP)
        - Significant PP (PP >= 4): Balance bonus applies
          * Quadratic scaling: TP=8 PP=8 >> TP=4 PP=4

        Balance ratio:
        - ratio = 1.0 (perfect balance): Strongest bonus
        - ratio <= 2.0 (good balance): Moderate bonus
        - ratio > 2.0 (unbalanced): No bonus

    Args:
        tp: Tensor parallelism degree
        pp: Pipeline parallelism degree
        ep: Expert parallelism degree
        num_experts: Number of experts (0 for dense models)
        param_count_b: Total parameter count in billions
        static_memory_gb: Static memory per rank (for memory-aware balance decisions)
        gpu_memory_gb: Total GPU memory available

        Balance bonus (negative = bonus, 0 = no bonus)

    - DP: gradient all-reduce (less frequent, PREFERRED for throughput)

    3. Make PP penalty scale with model size (cheap for huge models, expensive for small)
