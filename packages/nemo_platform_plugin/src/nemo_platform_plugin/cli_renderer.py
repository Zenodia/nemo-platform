"""Plugin-supplied renderers for streamed CLI output.

A plugin's :class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.cli.NemoCLI` can return a :class:`CLIRenderer`
subclass from :meth:`~nemo_platform_plugin.cli.NemoCLI.get_function_renderer` /
:meth:`~nemo_platform_plugin.cli.NemoCLI.get_job_renderer`. When supplied, the framework
drives the renderer's lifecycle around the verb's streamed output instead of
echoing each NDJSON frame as JSON to stdout.

Lifecycle:

- :meth:`CLIRenderer.on_start` — called once before iteration begins.
- :meth:`CLIRenderer.on_frame` — called once per frame as it arrives. For
  local ``run`` the frame is a :class:`~pydantic.BaseModel` (the value yielded
  by :meth:`~nemo_platform_plugin.function.NemoFunction.run`). For remote ``submit`` the
  frame is a ``dict`` (parsed JSON for one NDJSON line). Plugin renderers that
  want typed frames are responsible for parsing the dict themselves.
- :meth:`CLIRenderer.on_complete` — called once after the stream closes
  cleanly.
- :meth:`CLIRenderer.on_error` — called once when iteration raises (and the
  exception still propagates). Mutually exclusive with ``on_complete``.

Subclasses override only the methods they care about. Defaults are no-ops.

The framework bypasses the renderer entirely when the user has set the global
``--output-format json`` flag, falling back to the default per-frame JSON
echo. Renderers focus on TTY UX; automation gets a stable NDJSON contract.
