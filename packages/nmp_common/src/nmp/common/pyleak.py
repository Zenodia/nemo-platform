"""Pyleak utilities for detecting event loop blocking.

This module provides utilities for detecting synchronous/blocking operations
that block the asyncio event loop.

Usage:
    from nmp.common.pyleak import detect_blocking

    # Wrap specific code sections with a threshold
    async with detect_blocking(threshold=0.5):
        result = await db.execute(query)

Only blocking with useful stack traces (containing application code) will be
logged. Shallow stacks from framework/stdlib code are filtered out.
