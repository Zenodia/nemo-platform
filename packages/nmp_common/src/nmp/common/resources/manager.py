    This class manages resources that need to be shared between the jobs and
    models controllers when running in the same process. The primary use case
    is the GPU pool, which must be shared to prevent both controllers from
    allocating the same GPU to different workloads.

        manager = SharedResourceManager.get_instance()
        gpu_pool = manager.get_gpu_pool()
