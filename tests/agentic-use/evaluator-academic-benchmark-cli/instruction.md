# Academic Benchmark Evaluation (CLI)

You have access to the `nmp` CLI for NeMo Platform operations. Note: MCP tools are not available in this environment - you must use the CLI.

The `nmp` CLI is available at `/app/.venv/bin/nmp`. The CLI connects to the local NeMo Platform API server at http://localhost:8080 by default.

## Task

Set up and launch an academic benchmark evaluation job using the `nmp` CLI:

1. **Create a workspace** named `benchmark-eval-workspace`

2. **Discover available system benchmarks** - List the benchmarks available in the `system` workspace to find academic benchmarks like MMLU. System benchmarks are seeded asynchronously at startup, so if the list is initially empty, wait a few seconds and try again.

3. **Create an academic benchmark evaluation job** in the `benchmark-eval-workspace` workspace that runs an MMLU benchmark against a model. Use the following model configuration:
   - Model URL: `http://localhost:8000/v1`
   - Model name: `mock-model`

   The benchmark job spec should reference an MMLU system benchmark you discovered (e.g. `system/mmlu-instruct`).

4. **Verify the job was created** - Retrieve the job details and check its status. Note: in this environment the job may remain in "created" status since the job execution worker is not running - that is expected.

5. **List all benchmark jobs** in the workspace to confirm the job appears in the list.

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
- A workspace `benchmark-eval-workspace` exists
- System benchmarks were listed from the `system` workspace
- A benchmark evaluation job was created referencing an MMLU-based system benchmark
- The job details have been retrieved showing the job spec with the benchmark and model configuration
- The job appears in the benchmark jobs list
