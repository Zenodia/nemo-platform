# Auditor Target CRUD Operations (CLI)

You have access to the `nemo` CLI for NeMo Platform operations. Note: MCP tools are not available in this environment - you must use the CLI.

The `nemo` CLI is available at `/app/.venv/bin/nemo`. The CLI connects to the local NeMo Platform API server at http://localhost:8080 by default.

## Task

Complete the following Auditor target operations using the `nemo` CLI.

1. **Create** an audit target named `harbor-audit-target` that points to a model endpoint. Use the following details:
   - Model: `mock-model-endpoint`
   - Type: `nim`
   - Description: `Initial audit target for harbor testing`

2. **List** all audit targets and confirm `harbor-audit-target` appears in the list.

3. **Get** the audit target `harbor-audit-target` by name and review its details.

4. **Update** the audit target `harbor-audit-target` - change its description to `Updated audit target for harbor testing`.

5. **Delete** the audit target `harbor-audit-target`.

6. **Create** a final audit target named `harbor-audit-target-final` with the following details:
   - Model: `final-model-endpoint`
   - Type: `openai`
   - Description: `Final audit target that persists for verification`

## Available CLI Commands

- `nemo audit targets create <name> --model <model> --type <type> --description "<description>"` - Create an audit target
- `nemo audit targets list` - List all audit targets
- `nemo audit targets get <name>` - Retrieve an audit target by name
- `nemo audit targets update <name> --description "<description>"` - Update an audit target (pass only the fields you want to change)
- `nemo audit targets delete <name>` - Delete an audit target

### Target Types

The `--type` field specifies the model endpoint type. Common values: `nim`, `openai`.

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
- All six operations above have been performed successfully
- The target `harbor-audit-target` has been deleted (should no longer exist)
- The target `harbor-audit-target-final` exists with the correct configuration
