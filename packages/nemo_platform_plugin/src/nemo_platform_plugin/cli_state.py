"""Helpers for plugin CLI commands that need access to the CLI's state object.

The top-level ``nemo`` CLI populates ``typer.Context.obj`` with a state object
that exposes per-invocation handles to the platform SDK clients (sync and
async). The auto-generated ``run`` / ``submit`` verbs in
:mod:`nemo_platform_plugin.commands` consume that state through these helpers,
and **plugin-authored** Typer commands (i.e. anything a plugin registers via
:meth:`~nemo_platform_plugin.cli.NemoCLI.get_cli` rather than the
auto-generated verbs) should use the same surface so they participate in the
same protocol.

Example::

    import typer
    from nemo_platform_plugin.cli_state import resolve_local_cli_sdks

    def my_command(typer_ctx: typer.Context) -> None:
        sdk, async_sdk = resolve_local_cli_sdks(typer_ctx)
        if sdk is None and async_sdk is None:
            typer.echo("No NeMo Platform SDK is available.", err=True)
            raise typer.Exit(code=1)
        ...
"""

    typer_ctx: typer.Context,

    """Pull ``(sdk, async_sdk)`` out of the CLI state object on ``typer_ctx.obj``.

    Returns ``(None, None)`` when no state object is set (e.g. plugin tests
    that exercise a Typer app directly without populating ``ctx.obj``). When
    a state object is set but does not implement one of the getter methods,
    that side returns ``None`` while the other still resolves — letting
    callers decide which handle they actually need.
