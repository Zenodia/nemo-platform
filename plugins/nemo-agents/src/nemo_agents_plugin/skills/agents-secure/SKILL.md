# NeMo Agent Security

Audit a deployed agent for guardrails coverage and PII exposure in telemetry,
and produce actionable suggestions the user can apply.

## Workflow

1. **Pick an agent.** Run `nemo agents list` and prompt the user to choose one
   to audit. Use the rest of this skill on that single agent.
2. **Run the analysis steps** below — guardrails (config inspection),
   PII + secret regex scan (telemetry sample, via the bundled script), and
   optionally a deep-scan recommendation.
3. **Persist** snapshot + JSONL suggestions (see Persistence below).
4. **Surface suggestions** to the user and let them pick which to apply.

## Analysis steps

### 1. Guardrails on the model endpoint

Inspect the selected agent's config (from `nemo agents list`). Every configured
LLM should route through a `base_url` that contains `/guardrails/` (a
guardrails virtual-model endpoint). If any LLM does **not**, suggest creating
a guardrailed virtual model and pointing the agent at it.

Relevant catalog models (verify availability with `nemo models list`):

- `nvidia-llama-3-1-nemoguard-8b-content-safety`
- `nvidia-llama-3-1-nemoguard-8b-topic-control`
- `nvidia-llama-3-1-nemotron-safety-guard-8b-v3`

**Use the `inference` skill** for the exact
`nemo virtual-models create … --request-middleware …` syntax that wires
guardrail middleware in front of the chat model. Pure config inspection — no
telemetry download required.

### 2. PII + secret regex scan on recent telemetry

Sample recent telemetry files for the selected agent since the last run.
**Cap downloaded data at 1 GB total** — pick the most recent files until the
quota is hit; never download everything. Telemetry typically lives in the
`nemo-agent-telemetry` fileset (this is the same fileset the optimizer reads
for PII analysis).

Run the bundled scanner — **`resources/pii_scan.py` is the source of truth**
for patterns, false-positive guards, and masking. Don't re-implement the
regexes inline.

```bash
python3 <skill_dir>/resources/pii_scan.py <local-sample-dir-or-file>
# or stream:
nemo files download nemo-agent-telemetry --remote-path <file> -o - \
  | python3 <skill_dir>/resources/pii_scan.py -
```

Categories the script covers (anchored / prefix-led to keep FP rate low):

- **PII**: email, SSN, phone, credit card (Luhn-validated).
- **Cloud / cluster credentials**: AWS access key id, Google API key.
- **Source-control / CI tokens**: GitHub PATs (classic + fine-grained),
  GitHub OAuth tokens, GitLab PATs.
- **Model-provider API keys**: OpenAI (`sk-` / `sk-proj-`), Anthropic
  (`sk-ant-`), Hugging Face (`hf_`), NVIDIA (`nvapi-`).
- **Messaging / payments**: Slack tokens, Stripe secret keys.
- **Generic**: JWT, `-----BEGIN … PRIVATE KEY-----` blocks.

The script emits a single JSON object on stdout:

```json
{
  "scanned_files": ["…"],
  "scanned_bytes": 12345,
  "counts_by_type": {"email": 3, "openai_api_key": 1, …},
  "hits": [
    {"type": "email", "masked_preview": "j***@e****.com",
     "file": "…", "line": 42, "column": 17, "context": "…"}
  ]
}
```

False-positive guards are baked in (±80-char context check that drops
SSN-shaped digit runs near `request_id`/`build_id`, phone-shaped runs in
ISO timestamps or 10-digit Unix epochs, and credit cards that fail Luhn).
**Trust the script's verdict** — don't second-guess individual hits unless
you spot a category-level miss; if you do, fix the regex / guard in
`pii_scan.py` and re-run, don't paper over it in the agent message.

For each hit, emit one `data_safety` suggestion containing:

- The `masked_preview` (already masked by the script).
- The file + line/column it came from.
- Suggested follow-up: **Safe Synthesizer** (regenerate trace data without
  PII) and/or the Anonymizer service (redact in-place); for leaked secrets
  also flag **rotate the credential immediately** as the first action.

If `python3` is unavailable in the runtime environment, fall back to the
inline anchored regexes for email / SSN / phone / Luhn-validated credit
card and skip the secret scan rather than ship loose secret patterns.

### 3. Deep-scan recommendation (informational)

After the regex pass, inform the user that for higher recall they can run
**GLiNER** or **NemoGuard** content-safety models across the data — much
slower but catches PII and unsafe content the regexes miss. Suggest
selecting a subset of recent data first to keep wallclock reasonable.

Example invocation against a content-safety model (only emit if the model
exists in `nemo models list`):

```bash
nemo inference gateway model post v1/chat/completions <vm-name> \
  --workspace <ws> \
  --body '{"model":"<workspace>/nvidia-llama-3-1-nemoguard-8b-content-safety","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"<sample telemetry text>"}],"max_tokens":8,"temperature":0}'
```

This is informational — emit it as `suggested_actions` text rather than an
auto-apply step.

## Persistence (every run)

Uses fileset `nemo-agent-security`. This is **separate** from the optimizer
fileset (`nemo-agent-optimizer`) so the two skills can run independently
without one overwriting the other's snapshot or merging foreign suggestions.

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `security_snapshot.json` | Per-agent snapshot map; one entry per agent ever audited |
| `security_suggestions.jsonl` | One JSON object per line; survives applies |

### Snapshot shape (per-agent, single file)

The snapshot is **one JSON file at the fileset root**, keyed by agent name so
running the skill against agent A never overwrites agent B's snapshot:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "support-bot": {
      "guardrailsState": {
        "guarded": false,
        "unguardedModels": ["nvidia-llama-3-3-70b-instruct"]
      },
      "piiCountsByType": {"email": 3, "openai_api_key": 1},
      "deepScanRunAt": null,
      "updatedAt": "2026-05-07T12:34:56Z"
    },
    "triage-bot": {
      "guardrailsState": {"guarded": true, "unguardedModels": []},
      "piiCountsByType": {},
      "deepScanRunAt": "2026-05-06T09:11:02Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-05-06T09:11:02Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The legacy flat shape (the previous "single-agent" snapshot) is **read-only
backwards-compatible** — if you load a file without the top-level `agents`
key, treat the whole object as the snapshot for the *current* selected agent
and migrate to the keyed shape on the next save. Never write the legacy shape
back out.

### Load → update → save flow

1. Try to load the prior snapshot
   (`nemo files download nemo-agent-security --remote-path security_snapshot.json -o …`).
   - 404 → no snapshot exists yet for the workspace; treat as first run.
   - Snapshot exists but `agents[<selected>]` is missing → first run *for that
     agent*. Other agents' entries are preserved as-is on save.
   - Snapshot exists and `agents[<selected>]` is present → use that entry to
     decide whether to suppress already-actioned suggestions (e.g. drop the
     `deep_scan_recommended` tile if `deepScanRunAt` is set).
2. After analysis, **load → update only `agents[<selected>]` → save** the
   whole file. Never overwrite blindly with just the current agent's data —
   that would erase every other agent's snapshot.
3. **Merge** the suggestions JSONL (do not overwrite blindly):
   1. Load the existing file.
   2. Compute fresh suggestions for the selected agent.
   3. Preserve every record where `applied === true` as-is.
   4. Preserve every non-applied record whose `agent` field is **not** the
      currently selected agent — those belong to other agents' runs and must
      not be dropped here. (Workspace-scoped suggestions with no `agent`
      field are owned by the most recent run; replace them.)
   5. Drop any fresh suggestion whose identity tuple `(type, agent, model)`
      matches an applied record.
   6. Replace the selected agent's non-applied records with fresh output.
4. On first run the fileset may not exist — create it with
   `nemo files filesets create nemo-agent-security`.

### JSONL record shape

Same shape as `agents-optimize` so a downstream UI can ingest both
streams. One JSON object per line.

Required: `type`, `title`, `detail`. Optional: `agent`, `model`, `severity`,
`suggested_actions`, `apply`, `apply_description`, `applied`, `applied_at`.
Keep this backwards compatible — the object may be ingested downstream.

`detail` describes WHY the suggestion was raised. `apply_description` (if
`apply` is set) describes what pressing the Apply button will do.

| `type` value | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `guardrails` | Agent's model endpoint lacks content-safety guardrails |
| `data_safety` | Real PII or leaked secret detected in a telemetry sample |
| `deep_scan_recommended` | Suggest running GLiNER / NemoGuard for higher recall |

`severity` (optional) — use `low` / `medium` / `high`. PII hits in raw trace
content default to `high`; leaked API keys / private keys / JWTs default to
`high` with a "rotate immediately" line in `suggested_actions`; deep-scan
suggestions default to `low`.

### Optional `apply` block (one-click action)

Most security suggestions today are **textual** — they point the user at the
`inference` skill (to wire guardrails) or at Safe Synthesizer
(to regenerate telemetry). Emit `suggested_actions` with the literal CLI
commands the user should run.

If a future apply allowlist supports virtual-model creation
(`POST /apis/virtual-models/v1/workspaces/<ws>/...`) or guardrails-config
creation, an `apply` block with the **same shape and validation rules** as
the optimizer can be emitted. The current allowlist (in
`web/packages/studio/src/routes/AgentOptimizationsRoute/api.ts`) only covers
agent / deployment / evaluate-job actions, so omit `apply` for guardrails and
PII suggestions until the allowlist is extended.

If you do emit an `apply` block, follow the optimizer rules verbatim — see
the `agents-optimize` skill for the full method/path/origin/workspace/
allowlist contract. Cross-skill drift in the apply contract WILL cause
silent rejections at apply time.

## CLI reference (verified)

```bash
# List agents and models
nemo agents list
nemo models list --all-pages
nemo models list --filter.name nemoguard

# Telemetry inspection (for PII sample)
nemo files list nemo-agent-telemetry
nemo files download nemo-agent-telemetry \
  --remote-path <largest-recent-file> -o /tmp/sample.jsonl

# Files service for security persistence
nemo files filesets create nemo-agent-security
nemo files upload <path> nemo-agent-security \
  --remote-path security_suggestions.jsonl

# Calling a content-safety model through the gateway (deep scan)
nemo inference gateway model post v1/chat/completions <vm-name> \
  --workspace <ws> --body '<json>'
```

## What requires execution vs. what can be reasoned

**Reason directly from already-fetched data — no extra commands needed:**

- **Guardrails coverage**: inspect the agent's `config.llms[*].base_url` and
  `model_name` from `nemo agents list`. If no `/guardrails/` endpoint is in
  use, emit a `guardrails` suggestion. No telemetry download required.
- **Available guardrail/safety models**: read off `nemo models list` and pick
  the appropriate NemoGuard variant for the suggestion.

**Requires execution:**

- **PII + secret regex scan**: download a sample telemetry file (the largest
  recent one, capped at the 1 GB budget) and run
  `python3 <skill_dir>/resources/pii_scan.py <path>`. Parse the resulting
  JSON and emit one `data_safety` suggestion per hit. The script handles
  ±80-char FP guards, Luhn validation, and masking — don't re-implement.
- **Deep scan** (only if the user opts in): call a content-safety / GLiNER
  model through the inference gateway on a subset of recent traces.

## Execution checklist

- Run `nemo agents list`; prompt the user to pick one agent.
- Try to load prior snapshot
  (`nemo files download nemo-agent-security --remote-path security_snapshot.json -o …`).
  404 (or `agents[<selected>]` absent) → first run for this agent. Other
  agents' entries in the file are preserved on save.
- Inspect the selected agent's config — emit a `guardrails` suggestion if no
  `/guardrails/` endpoint is in use.
- If a telemetry fileset exists, download a sample (cap total ≤ 1 GB) and run
  `python3 <skill_dir>/resources/pii_scan.py <sample-path>`. Emit one
  `data_safety` suggestion per hit in the script's JSON output (the script
  has already applied FP guards and masking). Tag leaked-secret hits as
  `severity: high` with "rotate immediately" in `suggested_actions`.
- Always emit a `deep_scan_recommended` suggestion (informational) so the
  user knows GLiNER / NemoGuard exists as a more thorough fallback. Drop it
  if `agents[<selected>].deepScanRunAt` shows the user already actioned a
  deep-scan run.
- Create `nemo-agent-security` fileset if it doesn't exist
  (`nemo files filesets create nemo-agent-security`).
- Update only `agents[<selected>]` in the snapshot map and upload the whole
  file (`nemo files upload <path> nemo-agent-security --remote-path security_snapshot.json`).
  Do not write a flat single-agent shape — that erases every other agent.
- Merge + upload suggestions JSONL
  (`nemo files upload <path> nemo-agent-security --remote-path security_suggestions.jsonl`).
- Summarize key suggestions for the user. Let them pick which to apply.
