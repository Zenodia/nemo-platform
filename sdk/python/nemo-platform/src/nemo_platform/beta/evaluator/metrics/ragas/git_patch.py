Patch for GitPython to avoid Git dependency in containerized environments.

This module patches the git.refresh function to be a no-op, preventing
GitPython from trying to find the git executable during import.
This is particularly useful when using ragas which depends on GitPython
but doesn't actually need git functionality in a containerized environment.
